# Investing & Retirement (US)

> **Framing (read first).** This is **general educational information, NOT investment, tax, or financial advice, and NOT a recommendation to buy or sell any security.** All investing carries risk, including loss of principal; past performance does not guarantee future results. Contribution limits, income thresholds, and Social Security rules **change every year** — every dollar figure here is stated **as of 2026** (sourced from IRS Notice 2025-67 and SSA). Verify against the primary sources in *References* before relying on anything, and for your own situation consult a licensed **fee-only fiduciary** advisor and/or a tax professional.

**Where this sits.** Spoke of the **consumer-finance** family; the **`consumer-finance`** hub is the anchor. The sibling **`consumer-credit-and-debt`** hub owns credit/debt routing. This skill owns the *investing + retirement-savings* layer. It states the **tax treatment** of accounts but hands off tax-form depth to `personal-income-taxes`, deposit accounts/CDs to `personal-banking`, and life-insurance-as-"investment" to `personal-insurance` (see cross-references at the end).

This skill is deliberately **boring**: the evidence favors low-cost, diversified, long-horizon investing over stock-picking and market-timing. It will not give hot tips.

---

## Part 1: Core investing principles (the boring, evidence-based core)

1. **Risk and return are linked.** As potential return rises, so does risk. The SEC's plain-English rule: *there is no such thing as a high, guaranteed return.* If someone promises one, that is a fraud red flag (Part 5), not an opportunity.
2. **Compounding rewards time.** Returns earn returns, so starting earlier matters more than starting bigger; a long time horizon is the single biggest advantage a small investor has. *Illustration (hypothetical, not a projected return):* at a 7% annual return, money roughly doubles about every 10 years (the "rule of 72": 72 ÷ 7 ≈ 10), so a dollar invested at 25 has far more doubling cycles left than the same dollar invested at 45. Investor.gov's Compound Interest Calculator runs your own numbers.
3. **Diversification: don't put all your eggs in one basket.** Spreading money across many investments so one loss is cushioned by others reduces the risk tied to any single holding. A broad index fund diversifies in one purchase.
4. **Asset allocation** is how you split money among **stocks, bonds, and cash**, and it is the biggest driver of your risk/return mix. The right mix depends on your **risk tolerance** and **time horizon**, not on predictions: a longer horizon typically means more stock, and nearing the goal typically means more bonds/cash.
5. **Rebalance** periodically back to your target mix instead of chasing winners (for example, once a year, or when a holding drifts well past its target weight).
6. **Dollar-cost averaging (DCA).** Investing a fixed amount on a regular schedule (e.g., every paycheck) buys more shares when prices are low and fewer when high, and removes the temptation to time entry. This is how most 401(k) contributions already work.
7. **Don't try to time the market.** Staying invested through ups and downs has historically beaten trying to guess tops and bottoms. Time *in* the market beats *timing* the market.
8. **Costs are the one thing you control** (see Part 4). Low cost compounds in your favor.

**Time horizon → allocation (illustrative, not advice):** money needed within ~1–3 years generally should not be in the stock market at all (that is a `personal-banking` savings/CD question); money you won't touch for decades (retirement) can tolerate more stock and more short-term volatility.

## Part 2: Investment vehicles

| Vehicle | What it is | Why a beginner cares |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stocks (equities)** | Ownership in a company | Higher long-run return potential, higher volatility |
| **Bonds (fixed income)** | A loan to a government/company that pays interest | Lower volatility, income, ballast against stocks |
| **Mutual fund** | Pooled money professionally managed; priced once daily (NAV) | One-trade diversification; watch the **expense ratio** and any **loads** |
| **ETF (exchange-traded fund)** | A fund that **trades intraday like a stock** | Like a mutual fund but trades on an exchange; often low-cost and tax-efficient |
| **Index fund** | A mutual fund **or** ETF that simply tracks an index (e.g., total market) | The low-cost, diversified, "boring" default; no manager trying (and usually failing, net of fees) to beat the market |
| **Target-date fund (TDF)** | A single diversified fund tied to a retirement year (e.g., "2060") that **automatically grows more conservative** over time | A reasonable one-fund, set-and-forget option common in 401(k)s; still check its expense ratio |

**Mutual fund vs ETF (FINRA):** both bundle many securities and charge an annual expense ratio. Key differences: ETFs trade throughout the day at market price; traditional mutual funds transact once daily at NAV. Index versions of either are typically the cheapest.

**Active vs passive:** an **actively managed** fund pays a manager to try to beat a benchmark; an **index (passive)** fund just matches it cheaply. Because higher fees are a permanent handicap (Part 4), low-cost index funds are the evidence-based default for most long-term investors.

---

## Part 3: Retirement accounts (state the tax treatment; defer form depth to `personal-income-taxes`)

**The core tax distinction — Traditional vs Roth (applies to both 401(k)/403(b) and IRA):**
- **Traditional** = **pre-tax in, taxed out.** Contributions may reduce taxable income now; withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
- **Roth** = **after-tax in, tax-free out.** No deduction now; qualified withdrawals (and growth) come out tax-free later.
- Rough rule of thumb (not advice): Roth tends to favor those who expect a **higher** tax rate later; Traditional favors those who expect a **lower** rate later. Many people split. *The tax-form mechanics live in `personal-income-taxes`.*

### Employer plans: 401(k) / 403(b)
- **403(b)** is the nonprofit/public-school/government analog of the **401(k)**; they behave similarly.
- **Employer match = free money.** If an employer matches contributions, contributing at least enough to capture the **full match** is the highest-priority step in almost any plan. Not doing so leaves guaranteed compensation on the table.
- **Vesting:** the match may **vest** over time, either **cliff** (0% until a set date, then 100% at once) or **graded** (a rising percentage each year). You keep only the employer portion you're vested in if you leave; your own contributions are always 100% yours.
- **Fees matter even here:** under ERISA, plan **fiduciaries** must keep plan costs *reasonable* and disclose fees; you can usually pick the lowest-cost index/target-date option in the menu (Part 4, DOL).

### IRAs (Individual Retirement Arrangements; you open these yourself)
- **Traditional IRA** vs **Roth IRA** follow the tax split above.
- **Roth IRAs have income limits**; direct contributions phase out at higher incomes. Traditional-IRA *deductibility* phases out if you (or a spouse) are covered by a workplace plan.
- **Backdoor Roth:** high earners above the Roth income limit may contribute to a (nondeductible) Traditional IRA and then **convert** it to Roth. It is a legal, IRS-acknowledged workaround, but the **pro-rata rule** (the IRS taxes a conversion proportionally across *all* your pre-tax and after-tax IRA money, so existing pre-tax IRA balances make part of the conversion taxable) can create a surprise tax bill. This is a **see-a-tax-pro** maneuver (`personal-income-taxes`).

### Self-employed / small business
- **SEP-IRA:** employer (or self-employed person) funds a Traditional IRA in the employee's name; high contribution ceiling, simple.
- **SIMPLE IRA:** for small businesses with no other plan; employer + employee contributions, lighter administration and lower limits than a 401(k).

### 2026 contribution limits (as of 2026, IRS Notice 2025-67; **re-verify yearly**)
| Account | 2026 limit | Catch-up (age 50+) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 401(k)/403(b)/457/TSP elective deferral | **$24,500** | **+$8,000** (→ $32,500) | **Ages 60–63**: enhanced catch-up **$11,250** (SECURE 2.0) |
| IRA (Traditional **or** Roth, combined) | **$7,500** | **+$1,100** | |
| SIMPLE IRA | **$17,000** | **+$4,000** (ages 60–63: **$5,250**) | Lower limit/lighter admin than a 401(k) |

**2026 IRA income phase-outs (verify; thresholds shift yearly):** Roth direct-contribution phase-out **$153,000–$168,000** (single/HoH) and **$242,000–$252,000** (married filing jointly). Above the top of the range, direct Roth contributions aren't allowed (hence the backdoor route).

> **Boring priority order most educators suggest (not advice):** (1) contribute enough to **get the full employer match**; (2) pay down high-interest debt / hold an emergency fund (→ `budgeting-and-saving`, `consumer-credit-and-debt`); (3) max an **IRA** (Roth or Traditional); (4) go back and max the **401(k)**; (5) taxable brokerage after that.

## Part 4: Fees & expense ratios (why low-cost compounds)

- An **expense ratio** is the fund's annual operating cost as a **percentage of assets** (covers management, administrative, and 12b-1 fees). It is deducted from returns automatically, so you never see a bill, which is exactly why people ignore it.
- **Loads** (front-end/back-end sales charges) and **transaction fees** are *separate from* the expense ratio. Avoid loads when a no-load index equivalent exists.
- **FINRA's illustration:** a fund charging 1.85% must out-perform a 0.75% fund by **more than a full percentage point every year** just to tie. Over decades, a seemingly small fee gap compounds into a large chunk of your ending balance. Fees are a permanent headwind; low cost is a permanent tailwind.
- **Tools:** the **FINRA Fund Analyzer** compares the lifetime fee drag of specific funds; Investor.gov's **Compound Interest Calculator** shows the upside of compounding.
- **In a 401(k):** ERISA requires fee disclosure and that fiduciaries keep total plan costs reasonable (DOL). Use that disclosure to pick the cheapest broad-market or target-date option in the menu.

**Bottom line:** you can't control returns, but you *can* control costs, and cost is one of the few reliable predictors of long-run net performance.

---

## Part 5: Avoiding investment fraud (SEC / FINRA red flags)

Treat these as **stop signs**. Any one of them warrants walking away and verifying independently.

- **"Guaranteed" or "risk-free" high returns.** The #1 tell. Every real investment carries risk; guaranteed high return = fraud. Compare any promised yield against returns on well-known market indexes; wildly higher = wildly riskier or fake.
- **"Phantom riches" / "can't miss" / "huge upside, no risk"** pitches.
- **Pressure & urgency:** "limited spots," "act today," artificial deadlines.
- **Overly consistent returns** that never dip regardless of the market (a classic **Ponzi** signature: new investors' money pays earlier investors, and it collapses when inflows stop).
- **Unregistered products / unlicensed sellers**, or trouble getting paid out or getting straight answers.
- **Affinity fraud:** the fraudster is (or pretends to be) a member of your religious, ethnic, professional, military, or community group and leans on that trust. *Never* invest solely because someone "like you" vouches for it; verify anyway.
- **Crypto / social-media scam awareness:** the same red flags apply to crypto "opportunities," DMs, and "finfluencer" tips; guaranteed-return crypto and "send funds to unlock your gains" are scams. If you've already lost money or had identity/data compromised, see the broader recovery angle in **`identity-theft-and-credit-fraud`**, and report to the SEC/FTC.

**Always verify before you wire a dollar:**
- **FINRA BrokerCheck** (brokercheck.finra.org) — license, registration, and disciplinary history of a broker or firm.
- **SEC IAPD / Form ADV** (adviserinfo.sec.gov) — registration and disclosures for investment advisers.
- Confirm the *product* and the *person* are registered; "check out everything no matter how trustworthy the person seems" (SEC).

---

## Part 6: Social Security basics (claiming-age tradeoff)

**Full Retirement Age (FRA)** is **67** for anyone born **1960 or later** (it phased up from 66). FRA is when you get your *full* (unreduced) benefit. You choose when to start, between 62 and 70:

| Claim age | Effect on the monthly benefit (FRA = 67) |
| --- | --- |
| **62** (earliest) | **Permanently reduced**, roughly up to ~30% below the FRA amount |
| **67** (FRA) | 100% (full, unreduced) |
| **70** (latest worth waiting) | **Delayed Retirement Credits** add ~**+8%/year** (~0.667%/month) past FRA, so ~**24%** more than the FRA amount. Credits **stop at 70**; waiting longer adds nothing. |

**The tradeoff:** claiming early means more checks, each smaller; delaying means fewer checks, each larger (and a larger base for survivor benefits and cost-of-living adjustments). The "right" age depends on health, longevity expectations, other income, and spousal/survivor considerations. Run SSA's own calculators against your earnings record; this is a planning decision, not a one-size answer.

---

## Part 7: Getting help (robo vs advisor; how to vet)

- **Robo-advisor (digital/internet adviser):** software builds and rebalances a low-cost, diversified portfolio (often index ETFs) from your goals and risk tolerance; cheap, hands-off, and good for straightforward needs.
- **Human investment professionals (FINRA):** be aware that **"financial advisor," "financial planner," "wealth manager," "financial consultant"** are often **generic job titles, not credentials or licenses.** Ask what they're actually registered as (broker / investment adviser representative) and how they're paid.
- **Fee-only fiduciary vs commission:**
  - A **fiduciary** is held to act in *your* best interest. A **fee-only** advisor is paid **only by you** (flat, hourly, or % of assets under management) and earns **no commissions**, minimizing the conflict where a product is sold because it pays the seller.
  - **Commission/transaction-based** compensation can create incentives to sell higher-cost products. Always ask: *"Are you a fiduciary, 100% of the time, and how exactly are you paid?"*
- **How to vet anyone before hiring (do this every time):**
  1. **FINRA BrokerCheck** for brokers/firms; **SEC IAPD / Form ADV** for advisers.
  2. Check licenses, registration, and **disciplinary history / complaints**.
  3. Decode **professional designations**; some are rigorous, some are marketing (FINRA's designation lookup explains each).
  4. Get fees **in writing** and understand every layer (advisory fee *plus* the funds' expense ratios).
