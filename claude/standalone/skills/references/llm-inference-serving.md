# LLM Inference Optimization & Serving

Self-hosting an LLM means running an **inference server**: a long-lived process that loads model weights onto GPU(s) and turns a stream of incoming requests into generated tokens as fast and cheaply as possible. This reference covers the serving-engine landscape and the optimization techniques (2024–2026 SOTA) that separate a toy `model.generate()` loop from a production endpoint serving thousands of concurrent users.

**The one mental model that unlocks everything here:** LLM inference has two phases with opposite hardware profiles.

- **Prefill** (process the prompt): one big matrix-multiply over all prompt tokens at once. **Compute-bound** — saturates GPU FLOPs. Determines **Time To First Token (TTFT)**.
- **Decode** (generate output): one token at a time, each step reloading the entire model weights + KV cache from HBM to do tiny matmuls. **Memory-bandwidth-bound** — GPU FLOPs sit mostly idle. Determines **Time Per Output Token (TPOT)**.

Almost every technique below — continuous batching, PagedAttention, chunked prefill, disaggregation, speculative decoding — is an attempt to keep both the FLOP units and the memory bus busy despite this mismatch. Hold that tension in mind and the whole field becomes legible.

> Scope guard: this file is about the **serving runtime**. For the *algorithms* that shrink weights (GPTQ/AWQ/FP8/INT4), see the model-compression material (`da-7-machine-learning`); we only describe how a server *consumes* a quantized checkpoint. For attention *math* (FlashAttention, GQA), see the model-architecture material; we only describe how the server's attention *kernel* reads a paged KV cache. For managed AWS endpoints, see `aws-ai-ml`. For observing a running endpoint, see the `llm-observability` reference.

## 1. The serving-engine landscape (and how to choose)

A serving engine bundles: a scheduler (which requests run this step), a KV-cache memory manager, optimized attention/GEMM kernels, an API server (usually OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`), and increasingly multi-node orchestration. The 2024–2026 field consolidated around a handful.

| Engine | Origin | Differentiator | Best fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **vLLM** | UC Berkeley (Sky Lab) | PagedAttention; huge model + hardware coverage; V1 engine rewrite (2025); de-facto OSS default | General-purpose default; broadest model/HW support; the safe first choice |
| **SGLang** | Hao AI Lab / community | **RadixAttention** (cross-request prefix tree); fast structured output; strong on prefix-heavy & multi-turn | Agents, multi-turn chat, heavy shared prefixes, structured output |
| **NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM** | NVIDIA | Ahead-of-time **engine compilation** to TensorRT; tightest NVIDIA-kernel perf; FP8/FP4 on Hopper/Blackwell | Max throughput/latency on NVIDIA when you can afford a build/compile step; Triton deployments |
| **Hugging Face TGI** | Hugging Face | Production-hardened Rust router + Python shards; **TGI v3** long-prompt KV reuse; can use a TRT-LLM backend | HF ecosystem, simple Docker deploy, long chat histories |
| **LMDeploy** | InternLM / OpenMMLab | **TurboMind** engine: persistent batching, blocked KV, hand-tuned CUDA; strong quantized (4-bit) throughput | Max throughput-per-GPU, especially 4-bit Llama-family models |

**Datacenter-scale orchestration layer (2025+):** **NVIDIA Dynamo** (announced GTC 2025) sits *above* a single engine to coordinate large GPU fleets — disaggregated prefill/decode, KV-aware routing, and KV offloading via its NIXL transfer library and **KVBM** (KV Block Manager). **LMCache** is a complementary cross-engine KV layer giving "prefill-once, reuse-everywhere" semantics (offload KV to CPU/disk and share it across instances). These are not replacements for vLLM/SGLang/TRT-LLM — they wrap them.

**Choosing heuristics:**
- Start with **vLLM** unless you have a specific reason not to — best balance of throughput, TTFT, and model/hardware coverage.
- Prefix-heavy or agentic/multi-turn workload → **SGLang** (RadixAttention) often wins on TTFT and throughput.
- All-NVIDIA, latency-critical, and a compile step is acceptable → **TensorRT-LLM**.
- Deep in the HF stack or serving long chat histories → **TGI** (v3).
- Squeeze a quantized model onto the fewest GPUs → **LMDeploy/TurboMind**.
- Multi-node, reasoning-model, or disaggregated fleet → put **Dynamo** (and/or LMCache) on top of one of the above.

> Benchmark numbers move monthly and are workload-specific (model size, prompt/output length, batch). Treat any "engine X is N% faster" claim — including those in your own notes — as true only for that exact configuration. Always re-benchmark on your traffic shape. Cite the engine's own docs for current feature/perf claims.

## 2. PagedAttention & KV-cache memory management

During decode, the model attends to the keys/values of every prior token. Caching them (the **KV cache**) is what makes autoregressive generation tractable — but the cache is enormous and grows with every token.

**KV-cache size (rule of thumb):**
`bytes ≈ 2 (K and V) × num_layers × num_kv_heads × head_dim × seq_len × dtype_bytes × batch`
For a multi-billion-parameter model at long context this is often **tens of GB** — frequently rivaling or exceeding the weights, and it is the binding constraint on how many concurrent requests (how big a batch) you can serve.

**The problem PagedAttention solves:** naïve serving pre-allocates one contiguous KV buffer per request sized to `max_seq_len`. Requests that finish early or never reach max length waste that reservation → massive **internal + external fragmentation**, sometimes 60–80% of KV memory wasted.

**PagedAttention** (vLLM, SOSP 2023; the idea that launched vLLM) applies **OS virtual-memory paging** to the KV cache:
- KV cache is split into fixed-size **blocks** (vLLM default: 16 tokens per block).
- Each sequence has a **block table** mapping logical positions → arbitrary, non-contiguous physical blocks.
- Blocks are allocated **on demand** as the sequence grows, so reservation ≈ actual usage. Fragmentation drops to near-zero (only the last partial block of each sequence).
- Blocks can be **shared** across sequences (copy-on-write) — the basis for prefix caching (§5) and cheap parallel sampling / beam search.

The cost is an extra indirection in the attention kernel (gather KV from scattered blocks), which custom paged-attention kernels handle efficiently. Higher KV utilization → larger batches → higher throughput. **Essentially every modern engine now implements paged KV** (vLLM PagedAttention, TGI paged kernels, TRT-LLM paged KV cache, LMDeploy blocked KV, SGLang's radix-tree blocks).

**Beyond paging — the KV-cache memory hierarchy (2025):** when GPU KV memory fills, you can **offload** blocks to CPU RAM or NVMe instead of dropping/recomputing them: vLLM CPU offload, **LMCache**, Dynamo **KVBM**, FlexKV (GPU→CPU→SSD tiers via GPUDirect Storage / io_uring). This trades transfer latency for the ability to keep far more cached context "warm."

> KV-cache *compression by quantizing the cache itself* (e.g., FP8/INT8 KV) is a serving-side lever and is in scope as a knob; the *quantization algorithm* details are not (→ compression skill). GQA/MQA shrink `num_kv_heads` and thus KV size, but that is a **model-architecture** choice (→ architecture material), not a serving technique — here, just know that fewer KV heads = smaller cache = bigger batches.

---

## 3. Continuous (in-flight) batching

GPUs are only efficient when batched, but LLM requests have wildly different output lengths and arrive at random times. The batching strategy is, after KV memory, the single biggest throughput lever.

- **Static / dynamic batching (the old way):** assemble a batch, run it to completion, return all results together. The whole batch is held hostage by its longest-generating member; finished sequences leave their GPU slot idle ("bubble"). Terrible GPU utilization for mixed-length generation.
- **Continuous batching** (a.k.a. **in-flight batching**, **iteration-level scheduling**; from Orca, OSDI 2022): the scheduler makes decisions **every decode iteration**, not every request. The moment a sequence emits its EOS token its slot is freed and a *waiting* request is admitted mid-flight. The batch composition churns continuously, keeping the GPU saturated.

This is now table stakes — vLLM, TGI, TRT-LLM (in-flight batching), LMDeploy (persistent batching), and SGLang all do it. The remaining nuance is the **scheduling policy**: how to admit/preempt requests and how to interleave compute-bound prefills with memory-bound decodes — which is exactly what chunked prefill (§4) and disaggregation (§6) address.

**Admission & preemption:** when KV memory is exhausted the scheduler must either **recompute** (evict a request's KV and re-prefill it later — cheap memory, wasted compute) or **swap** KV out to CPU (preserves compute, costs transfer bandwidth). Token-budget caps (`max_num_batched_tokens`) and max-concurrency limits bound how aggressively requests are packed.

---

## 4. Chunked prefill & scheduling

The core scheduling conflict: a long prompt's prefill is one giant compute-bound op. If you run it as a single batch step, every in-flight decode stalls for its duration → a **TPOT spike / jitter** for all current users every time a long prompt arrives.

**Chunked prefill** (a.k.a. dynamic/split-fuse prefill; Sarathi/Sarathi-Serve) splits a long prefill into fixed-size token chunks and **piggybacks** each chunk into a batch alongside ongoing decode tokens. One step might be "512 prefill tokens from request A + 30 decode tokens from requests B–F." Because prefill is compute-bound and decode is memory-bound, fusing them in one step **uses both the FLOP units and the memory bus** — the best single-engine answer to the prefill/decode tension.

**vLLM V1 (2025) made this the default architecture.** The V1 rewrite introduced a **unified scheduler** that abandons the prefill-vs-decode distinction entirely: scheduling is just a dict `{request_id: num_tokens_to_process}`. This one representation cleanly expresses chunked prefill, prefix caching, *and* speculative decoding. V1's default policy prioritizes decode tokens (protect TPOT for current users), batches them, then fills the remaining `max_num_batched_tokens` budget with prefill chunks; an oversized prefill is automatically chunked. V1 also integrated FlashAttention 3 to handle mixed prefill+decode batches.

**The key tuning knob is `max_num_batched_tokens`** (the per-step token budget):
- **Smaller** budget → smaller prefill chunks → lower decode jitter / better TPOT, but more steps to finish a prefill → higher TTFT and lower peak throughput.
- **Larger** budget → faster prefills / higher throughput, but bigger TPOT spikes.
This is the latency↔throughput dial you turn to hit your SLOs (§7).

---

## 5. Prefix / prompt caching

If two requests share a prefix — a long system prompt, a few-shot block, a RAG context, or the conversation history in a multi-turn chat — the KV cache for that prefix is **identical**. Recomputing it per request is pure waste, and prefill is the expensive phase.

**Automatic Prefix Caching (APC)** keeps prefixes' KV blocks around (hash blocks by their token content + position) and **reuses** them when a new request's prefix matches. The matched prefix skips prefill entirely → dramatic TTFT reduction and prefill-compute savings on prefix-heavy traffic. PagedAttention's block sharing (§2) is the enabling mechanism. vLLM exposes this as `enable_prefix_caching`.

**SGLang's RadixAttention** generalizes this: instead of per-request prefix matching, it maintains a **radix tree (trie) of the KV cache across *all* concurrent requests**, managed with LRU eviction. This enables:
- **Multi-level sharing** — chains of shared prefixes, not just one prompt depth.
- **Fork/branch** — when one request branches into multiple completions (parallel sampling, tree-of-thought, agent fan-out), children automatically share the parent's cached KV.
This is why SGLang shines on agents and multi-turn chat — reported large speedups on prefix-heavy traffic vs. per-request caching.

**The trade-off you must respect:** cached prefixes occupy KV memory that could otherwise serve new requests. When prefix overlap is **low** and KV memory is tight, the cache is pure overhead and can *reduce* serviceable concurrency. Prefix caching is a big win for system-prompt/RAG/chat workloads and a liability for high-cardinality, low-overlap traffic.

**Distinguish three cache layers** (don't conflate them):
1. **Prefix/KV caching** — reuse computed KV blocks for *exact-prefix-match* tokens (this section). Exact match, lossless.
2. **Provider "prompt caching"** — the same idea exposed as a billing feature by hosted APIs (cached prefix tokens billed cheaper). For consuming this on a provider's API, see `llm-integration-reviewer` / `aws-ai-ml`.
3. **Semantic caching** — return a *stored response* for a *semantically similar* (not identical) query, via embedding match (GPTCache, Redis). Different layer, approximate, can return stale/wrong answers — a correctness risk, not a KV technique.

---

## 6. Disaggregated prefill/decode serving

Chunked prefill (§4) *interleaves* the two phases on the same GPU. **Disaggregation** takes the opposite tack: run prefill and decode on **physically separate GPU pools**, then transfer the KV cache from prefill workers to decode workers over a fast interconnect.

- **Why:** prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) interfere when co-located — a heavy prefill batch tanks decode TPOT and vice-versa. Separating them **eliminates the interference** and lets each pool be **sized, batched, and even hardware-matched independently** (e.g., compute-dense GPUs for prefill, bandwidth-dense for decode). Foundational systems: **DistServe** (OSDI 2024) and **Splitwise** (ISCA 2024).
- **The metric it optimizes is goodput** (§7), not raw throughput — completed requests *that meet SLOs* per second per GPU.
- **The cost:** you must **move the KV cache** from prefill to decode GPUs every request. This needs a fast path (NVLink / RDMA / InfiniBand) and a transfer library — NVIDIA's **NIXL** in Dynamo; **LMCache** uses NIXL for prefill→decode KV transfer. KV-cache offload/routing makes this practical at fleet scale.
- **KV-aware routing:** the router sends a request to the prefill/decode worker whose cache already holds the most overlapping blocks, balancing cache-hit rate against load — avoiding redundant KV regeneration across the fleet (Dynamo).

**Aggregation vs. disaggregation is an open debate (2024–2026).** Disaggregation removes interference but can waste resources (compute and memory are managed in coupled units, and the split ratio rarely matches traffic exactly); chunked-prefill *aggregation* maximizes single-node utilization but can't fully escape the tension under tight SLOs. By mid-2025 essentially every major framework (vLLM, SGLang, Dynamo, LMCache) supports PD disaggregation for large-scale deployments, and hybrid/adaptive approaches are active research. **Rule of thumb:** disaggregation earns its complexity at **scale** (many GPUs, reasoning models with huge prefills or very long decodes); for a single node, chunked prefill is simpler and usually sufficient.

## 7. Latency / throughput metrics & SLOs

You cannot tune what you cannot measure, and "tokens/sec" alone hides the user experience. The canonical metric set:

| Metric | Means | Driven by | User-facing meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TTFT** (Time To First Token) | Request arrival → first token | Prefill (prompt length, queueing, prefix-cache hit) | How long the UI "spins" before text appears |
| **TPOT** / **ITL** (Time Per Output Token / Inter-Token Latency) | Avg gap between successive output tokens | Decode (memory bandwidth, batch size) | Perceived streaming "smoothness" / reading speed |
| **End-to-end latency** | Arrival → last token | `≈ TTFT + TPOT × num_output_tokens` | Total wait for a complete response |
| **Throughput** | Total output (or total) tokens/sec across all requests | Batch size, GPU utilization | Capacity / how many users you can serve |
| **Goodput** | Requests/sec that **meet their TTFT *and* TPOT SLOs** | Everything above, jointly | The metric that actually matters in production |

- **TTFT vs. throughput are different problems** with opposite levers. Bigger batches raise throughput but, by interleaving heavy prefills with decodes, can regress *both* TTFT and TPOT. This is the **fundamental latency↔throughput trade-off**; you tune toward an SLO, not toward a single maximum.
- **Goodput is the right north star.** A server can post huge raw throughput while violating everyone's latency SLO (massive batches → great tokens/sec, terrible TTFT). Goodput counts only SLO-compliant requests, capturing cost *and* service quality in one number — it's exactly what disaggregation (§6) optimizes.
- **Always report percentiles (p50/p90/p99), never just the mean.** Tail latency is where SLOs break, especially under bursty load and long-prompt jitter.
- **Benchmark on your real traffic shape.** Input/output length distribution, request arrival pattern (Poisson vs. bursty), and concurrency dominate the numbers. Tools: vLLM's `benchmark_serving`, LLMPerf, sglang.bench_serving, GenAI-Perf (Triton). Synthetic uniform-length benchmarks overstate real-world throughput.

**Setting SLOs:** derive them from the use case. Interactive chat: TTFT under a few hundred ms, TPOT below human reading speed (~6–10 tokens/sec is fine; faster is better). Batch/offline (summarization, evals): TTFT barely matters — maximize throughput/goodput and minimize cost-per-token (§9). Voice/agent loops: TTFT and tail latency dominate.

---

## 8. Multi-GPU & multi-node inference (parallelism)

When a model (weights + KV cache for your target batch/context) doesn't fit on one GPU, or one GPU can't hit your latency/throughput target, you partition across GPUs. **These compose** (e.g., TP within a node × PP across nodes).

- **Tensor Parallelism (TP):** split each layer's weight matrices *across* GPUs; every GPU does part of every layer and they **all-reduce** activations each layer. Uses Megatron-LM-style sharding. **Pros:** reduces per-GPU memory *and* per-token latency (more aggregate bandwidth per token). **Cons:** an all-reduce per layer → needs very fast intra-node interconnect (**NVLink**); degrades badly across slow inter-node links. **Rule:** use TP **within a node**, set `tensor_parallel_size` = GPUs per node. Best lever for *latency*.
- **Pipeline Parallelism (PP):** split the model by *layers* into stages, one stage per GPU/node; activations pass stage→stage. **Pros:** only small activation tensors cross the link → tolerates **slower inter-node** networks (Ethernet/InfiniBand). **Cons:** introduces **pipeline bubbles** (stages idle waiting for upstream) unless micro-batched well; helps throughput more than single-request latency. **Rule:** use PP **across nodes**, `pipeline_parallel_size` = number of nodes. Example: 16 GPUs as 2×8 → `TP=8, PP=2`.
- **Expert Parallelism (EP):** for **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** models, place different experts on different GPUs and route tokens to the GPU holding the chosen expert. Lets you scale total parameters without every GPU holding every expert; load-balancing the routing is the hard part. Increasingly central as frontier OSS models go MoE.
- **Data Parallelism (DP):** replicate the whole model and split *requests* across replicas. Pure throughput/horizontal scaling; the unit you **autoscale** (§9). vLLM also supports **context/sequence parallelism** for very long contexts.

**Runtimes:** vLLM uses native multiprocessing for single-node and **Ray** for multi-node; TRT-LLM and others use NCCL collectives. **Heuristic order:** fit on 1 GPU if you can (cheapest, no comm overhead) → TP within a node for memory/latency → add PP across nodes only when a single node can't hold the model → DP replicas for horizontal capacity → EP if (and only if) the model is MoE.

---

## 9. Constrained / structured decoding at the serving layer

Applications need machine-readable output — JSON matching a schema, a valid SQL/regex/grammar, a tool call with the right argument shape. **Constrained (guided) decoding** *guarantees* validity by, at each decode step, computing a **token mask** that zeroes out any next-token that would violate the target structure, so only conforming tokens can be sampled. Unlike prompt-and-pray or retry loops, it is a **hard guarantee** with (when done right) near-zero added latency.

**Mechanisms:**
- **Regex / JSON-schema → finite-state machine (FSM):** compile the constraint to an FSM whose state determines the allowed token set. **Outlines** pioneered compiling schemas to index structures for O(1) valid-token lookup per step.
- **Context-free grammar → pushdown automaton:** for nested structures (full JSON, code, custom grammars) an FSM isn't enough; a stack-based automaton tracks nesting. **XGrammar** (MLSys 2025) splits the vocabulary into context-independent vs. context-dependent tokens and precomputes masks, reaching well under ~40µs/token — and is the **default structured-generation backend for vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM**. **llguidance** (Microsoft, Rust Earley parser) and **Guidance/Outlines** are the other main backends.

**Serving-level concerns** (this is why it lives here, not in prompt engineering):
- **Per-step mask latency** must be hidden behind GPU compute or it dominates TPOT — hence the heavy engineering (precomputed/cached masks, context-independent token sets). Naïve grammar masking can be 100× slower than XGrammar's approach.
- **Interaction with batching & speculative decoding:** masks must be applied per-sequence within a continuous batch, and verified against drafted tokens under speculative decoding (§10).
- **Tool/function calling** is usually implemented *as* constrained decoding under the hood (constrain output to the tool's JSON-schema). vLLM/SGLang/TGI/TRT-LLM all expose `guided_json` / `response_format` / grammar parameters.
- **Validity ≠ correctness/quality.** Constraining structure can shift the output distribution and occasionally degrade content quality; the model can emit *schema-valid nonsense*. Constrain structure, but still validate semantics downstream.

---

## 10. Speculative decoding

Decode is memory-bandwidth-bound: each step reloads all weights to produce *one* token, leaving FLOPs idle. **Speculative decoding** exploits that idle compute to generate **multiple tokens per step** — **losslessly**, with provably the same output distribution as the target model (when verification is done correctly).

**The pattern:** a cheap **draft** proposes the next *k* tokens; the expensive **target** verifies all *k* in a **single forward pass** (cheap, because verification is one parallel pass over k tokens — compute it had to spare). Tokens are accepted up to the first mismatch via rejection sampling that preserves the target's distribution; on rejection, generation resumes from there. If the draft is good, you get several tokens for roughly the cost of one target pass. **Speedup ≈ average accepted tokens per step**, and is **workload-dependent** (predictable text → high acceptance → big speedup; surprising text → low). It is **lossless** — quality is identical to the target; only speed changes. Trade-offs: extra memory/complexity for the drafter, and low acceptance can even *slow you down*.

**The family (the part that moves fastest):**
- **Draft-model (vanilla) SD:** a small separate model of the *same family* drafts. Simple, but needs a well-matched small model and runs a second model.
- **Prompt Lookup / n-gram (PLD):** "draft" by copying spans from the prompt/context — free, great for summarization/RAG/code-edit where output echoes input. No model needed.
- **Medusa:** add extra **decoding heads** to the target model that predict several future tokens in parallel (tree-attention to verify multiple candidate continuations). No separate draft model.
- **Lookahead decoding:** uses Jacobi-style parallel decoding to generate and verify n-grams in place; no draft model or extra heads.
- **EAGLE / EAGLE-2 / EAGLE-3:** the dominant line by mid-2026. Draft at the **feature (hidden-state) level** rather than the token level. **EAGLE-2** adds a dynamic draft *tree* with context-aware acceptance. **EAGLE-3** (NeurIPS 2025) fuses features from **early/middle/late** target layers and predicts **tokens directly**, removing a scaling ceiling — reported ~3–6.5× over vanilla autoregressive and ~20–40% over EAGLE-2. Many engines now ship EAGLE/EAGLE-3 support.

**Serving integration:** vLLM (V1's unified scheduler explicitly supports speculative tokens), SGLang, and TRT-LLM all support speculative decoding; it composes with continuous batching and (carefully) with constrained decoding. Acceptance rate falls as batch size grows (the spare compute shrinks), so SD helps most in **low-batch, latency-sensitive** regimes — exactly where you'd otherwise be memory-bound.

---

## 11. Autoscaling & cost-per-token

Self-hosting only beats a pay-per-token API if your GPUs stay **busy**. An idle reserved GPU bills 24/7; the whole economic game is matching capacity to demand.

**Cost-per-token** is the real unit economic: `GPU $/hour ÷ (tokens/sec × 3600)`. It's dominated by **utilization**, so every throughput technique above (batching, paged KV, quantized weights to fit a smaller/cheaper GPU) is also a *cost* lever. Reported community break-evens (workload-specific): a dedicated GPU beats serverless/API roughly past **~40–70% sustained utilization**; below that, serverless or a hosted API is cheaper.

**Autoscaling patterns:**
- **Horizontal (replica) scaling:** add/remove whole model replicas (data-parallel, §8) behind a load balancer. Scale on a signal that reflects LLM load — **queue depth / pending requests / GPU utilization**, *not* CPU% (misleading for GPU work). **KServe + Knative** scales replicas on concurrent requests and can **scale to zero**; **KEDA** scales on pending-request/custom metrics (e.g., on OpenShift AI / vLLM).
- **Scale-to-zero & cold starts:** dropping to zero replicas saves the most money but reintroduces a **cold start** — loading tens of GB of weights to GPU can take seconds to minutes. Mitigations: weight streaming/snapshotting, fast-boot tech (e.g., Runpod FlashBoot claims sub-250ms), keeping a warm pool, or a small always-on floor. Scale-to-zero suits **spiky/dev** traffic; steady production keeps a warm minimum.
- **Serverless GPU** (Runpod, Modal, Northflank, etc.) bills per-second of actual compute → zero cost at zero traffic, at the price of cold-start risk and less control. **Managed inference** (Bedrock, SageMaker endpoints) offloads all of this — for those, see `aws-ai-ml`.
- **Provisioned vs. on-demand vs. spot:** reserve/commit capacity for the steady baseline (cheapest per hour), burst on on-demand, use spot/preemptible for fault-tolerant batch.

**Cost levers, in rough order of impact:** raise utilization (batching + right-sizing); use a **quantized** model to fit a smaller/cheaper GPU or bigger batch (algorithm → compression skill; *deploying* it is the serving lever); enable prefix caching for shared-prefix traffic; pick the highest-goodput engine/config for your SLO; autoscale aggressively (scale-to-zero for spiky, warm-floor for steady); batch/offline jobs on spot at max batch size.

---

## Anti-patterns

- **Optimizing raw throughput while violating latency SLOs.** Cranking batch size posts great tokens/sec and a terrible TTFT/TPOT. Optimize **goodput**, report **percentiles**.
- **Benchmarking with uniform synthetic lengths.** Real traffic has skewed input/output distributions and bursty arrivals; uniform benchmarks overstate throughput and hide tail latency. Replay realistic traffic.
- **Enabling prefix caching for low-overlap traffic.** On high-cardinality prompts with little shared prefix, the KV cache is dead weight that *reduces* serviceable concurrency. It's a win only when prefixes actually repeat.
- **Tensor parallelism across slow links.** TP all-reduces every layer; without NVLight/NVLink-class interconnect it cripples throughput. Cross-node → pipeline parallelism, not TP.
- **Reserving a 24/7 GPU for spiky traffic.** Below ~40–70% utilization a dedicated endpoint loses to serverless/API on cost-per-token. Autoscale or use a hosted API.
- **Treating constrained decoding as a correctness guarantee.** It guarantees *structure*, not *meaning* — the model can emit schema-valid nonsense. Validate semantics downstream.
- **Assuming speculative decoding always helps.** Low acceptance (surprising outputs) or large batches (no spare compute) can make it net-negative. Measure acceptance rate on your workload.
- **Over-disaggregating a single node.** Prefill/decode disaggregation pays off at fleet scale; on one node it adds KV-transfer overhead and complexity for little gain — use chunked prefill instead.
- **Ignoring the KV cache when sizing GPUs.** People size for weights and OOM under concurrency because KV grows with batch×context and often exceeds the weights. Budget KV memory explicitly.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Where to look |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OOM at moderate concurrency | KV cache, not weights, exhausting HBM | Cap `max_num_seqs`/`max_model_len`; enable prefix caching only if it helps; quantize weights/KV; add KV offload; raise `gpu_memory_utilization` cautiously |
| TTFT spikes when long prompts arrive | Big prefills monopolizing steps | Enable/tune **chunked prefill**; lower `max_num_batched_tokens`; consider PD disaggregation at scale |
| TPOT jitter / uneven streaming | Prefills interleaving with decodes; oversized batches | Smaller token budget; prioritize decode in scheduler (vLLM V1 default); disaggregate |
| High throughput but users complain | Optimizing throughput over latency | Switch target metric to **goodput**; check p90/p99 TTFT/TPOT, not means |
| Speculative decoding gives no/negative speedup | Low draft acceptance or batch too large | Measure acceptance rate; try EAGLE-3 / prompt-lookup; restrict SD to low-batch latency-critical path |
| Multi-node throughput collapses | TP all-reduce over slow inter-node link | Use **PP across nodes, TP within node**; verify NVLink/NCCL topology |
| Structured output slow (low tok/s) | Naïve per-step grammar mask | Use **XGrammar**/llguidance backend; ensure masks precomputed/cached |
| Cost-per-token too high | Low GPU utilization | Right-size GPU + raise batch; quantize to smaller GPU; autoscale / scale-to-zero for spiky; or move to hosted API below break-even |
| Cold starts after scale-to-zero | Multi-GB weight load to GPU | Warm-pool floor, weight streaming/snapshot, fast-boot runtime; reserve scale-to-zero for spiky traffic only |
