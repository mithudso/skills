## Atlas quick rules

1. Treat **Atlas** as the control plane and **MongoDB drivers / mongosh** as
   the main data-plane application surfaces.
2. Prefer **service accounts** over legacy API keys for new Atlas Admin API
   automation.
3. Remember the **Atlas Admin API does not read or write your cluster data**;
   it manages Atlas resources and access configuration.
4. Design schemas around **access patterns**; data accessed together should
   generally live together.
5. Prefer **embedding** when it lets common reads complete as a single-document
   fetch; use transactions only when requirements truly cross document
   boundaries.
6. Add indexes for repeated query patterns, but account for the **write cost**
   of every index.
7. Use **Performance Advisor**, cluster metrics, alerts, and limits together;
   Atlas performance work is not just about query syntax.
8. Treat **IP access lists, private networking, database users, and Atlas
   users** as distinct security controls with different scopes.
9. Use **Atlas Search** for full-text/relevance workloads and **Atlas Vector
   Search** for semantic similarity/RAG workloads; they are related but not the
   same feature.
10. Check **deployment tier, MongoDB version, and Atlas limits** before giving
    prescriptive advice.
11. Know the **Flex / Free / Dedicated** tier model; Serverless and M2/M5 have
    been removed and auto-migrated to Flex — they cannot be newly provisioned.
12. Consider **Atlas Stream Processing** for event-driven and real-time ETL
    workloads before building external pipelines.
13. For hybrid retrieval, use **`$rankFusion`** (MongoDB 8.1+) to merge
    full-text and vector results in a single query.
14. **Queryable Encryption** is available for sensitive fields that still need
    to be queried; equality/range queries are GA, prefix/suffix/substring are
    in preview on 8.2+. For CSFLE/QE setup and key management, use
    `mongodb-operations-expert`.

## What Atlas expertise should mean

Atlas expertise spans **control-plane design** (organizations, projects,
deployments, users, network boundaries, backups, monitoring, limits,
automation), **application access** (drivers, connection strings, pooling,
query/index fit, aggregation, search, vector search), **operations** (alerts,
metrics, Performance Advisor, capacity, topology, backup/DR posture),
**delivery models** (UI, Admin API, CLI, Terraform, AKO), **streaming**
(Atlas Stream Processing), and **AI/agentic patterns** (automated embedding,
vector search, hybrid search, RAG, agent memory) — the areas mapped
throughout this file.

## Atlas operating model

### Shared responsibility

- Atlas Architecture Center explicitly frames Atlas through a **shared
  responsibility model**: MongoDB operates the underlying platform, while
  customers own their configuration, access control, and data policies.
- Atlas architectural guidance is organized around five pillars:
  **operational efficiency, security, reliability, performance, and cost
  optimization**.

### Core control-plane hierarchy

- Atlas operations are anchored around **organizations, projects, and
  deployments/clusters**.
- Many role assignments and operational actions are scoped differently at the
  organization vs project layer, so advice should always name the required
  scope.

### Deployment and connectivity model

- Atlas lets teams choose deployment tier (**Free, Flex, or Dedicated**), cloud
  provider, and region based on application latency, cost, and security
  requirements. Serverless instances and M2/M5 clusters have been removed and
  auto-migrated to Flex, their replacement; neither can be newly provisioned.
- Application environments must satisfy both **network access** and
  **database-user authentication** to reach an Atlas deployment.
- Private connectivity choices include **VPC/VNet peering** and **private
  endpoints**, while public connectivity requires IP allow-listing.

## Atlas interaction methods inventory

This is the high-value inventory of **how you can work with Atlas** — surface,
best fit, and representative methods in one place. For exact subcommands or
endpoints, follow the linked source sections.

| Surface | Best fit | Representative methods/actions | Primary source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Atlas UI | manual ops, investigations, operator workflows | interactive administration, dashboards, backup/alerts/metrics, one-off ops | Atlas docs home |
| Atlas Admin API v2 | CI/CD, automation, inventory, governance, integration tooling | OAuth token exchange, org/project listing, deployment management, DB user management, IP address retrieval, alert/backup administration | Admin API v2 |
| Atlas CLI | local operator workflows, scripts, quick admin actions | `atlas setup`, `atlas api`, `atlas accessLists list`, `atlas accessLists describe`, resource-family subcommands | Atlas CLI |
| Atlas Terraform provider | reproducible provisioning, policy-reviewed infra, GitOps-style Atlas infra | `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, `terraform destroy` against Atlas provider resources | Terraform |
| Atlas Kubernetes Operator | platform teams aligning Atlas lifecycle to Kubernetes control planes | `AtlasProject`, `AtlasDeployment`, `AtlasDatabaseUser` custom resources and reconciliation | AKO docs |
| MongoDB drivers | production application code | official driver CRUD/query/aggregation/index/transaction APIs by language | Drivers |
| mongosh / Compass / connection strings | local exploration, DBA/dev workflows | debugging, admin inspection, direct database access | Connect to deployment + Manual/Drivers |
| Atlas Search | autocomplete, faceting, ranked text search | `$search`, `$searchMeta`, analyzers, mappings, facet, pagination | Atlas Search |
| Atlas Vector Search | AI applications, semantic retrieval, agentic systems | vector index creation, ANN/ENN vector search, hybrid search, automated embedding | Atlas Vector Search |
| Atlas Stream Processing | event-driven apps, real-time ETL, time-series ingestion | continuous stream processing using aggregation-pipeline syntax | Atlas Stream Processing |

## Atlas Admin API standards

- The Atlas Admin API is a **REST-style control-plane API** for Atlas resource
  administration.
- The preferred authentication method is **OAuth2 service-account access
  tokens**; HTTP Digest API keys are a **legacy** option.
- Service-account tokens are obtained from
  `POST https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/oauth/token` and are reusable for about
  one hour.
- If your organization requires an **API IP access list**, token generation can
  happen from any IP, but API calls that use the token must come from an
  allowed IP.
- The Admin API does **not** expose application data access; reading and
  writing database documents still happens through cluster auth plus a driver or
  other data-plane client.
- As of **March 2026**, the Admin API enforces **standardized rate limiting**
  using a token-bucket algorithm. Automation code must handle `429 Too Many
  Requests` responses and respect `Retry-After` headers.

### Admin API categories to expect

For exact endpoints, use the API reference. In practice, Atlas Admin API work
usually falls into these buckets:

- **organizations and projects**
- **deployments / clusters / topology**
- **database users and access**
- **network access and IP lists**
- **alerts and monitoring metadata**
- **backup and restore administration**
- **inventory, IP address, and project metadata**

## Atlas CLI standards

- Atlas CLI is the terminal-native Atlas control-plane surface.
- `atlas setup` is the fast-start command that signs up or authenticates,
  creates a free database, loads sample data, adds the current IP to the access
  list, creates a database user, and connects with `mongosh`.
- Atlas CLI is appropriate for **operator workflows and scripts**, but when a
  task needs stable, reviewable automation, the Admin API or Terraform may be a
  better fit.
- Atlas docs explicitly surface CLI entry points for actions like **access list
  inspection** and other Atlas resource operations.

## Terraform and Kubernetes Operator standards

### Terraform

- Use Terraform when you want **declarative Atlas infrastructure management**.
- The Atlas Terraform provider is the main Atlas IaC surface for
  provisioning/managing clusters and related Atlas resources from code.
- MongoDB’s guide expects **service-account authentication** for provider
  configuration.
- **Provider 2.0** (2025) introduced semantic versioning with no-breaking-change
  guarantees in minor/patch releases. Projects on 1.x must follow the 2.0.0
  Upgrade Guide before upgrading. See the refresh section below for details.

### Atlas Kubernetes Operator

- Use Atlas Kubernetes Operator when Atlas resources need to be managed from a
  **Kubernetes control plane**.
- AKO manages Atlas state from **custom resources** like `AtlasProject`,
  `AtlasDeployment`, and `AtlasDatabaseUser`.
- AKO 2.0 changed deletion behavior: deleting a Kubernetes custom resource no
  longer deletes the Atlas resource by default.
- The docs explicitly warn to **define desired config values explicitly** to
  avoid inheriting Atlas defaults that can cause reconciliation loops.

## Atlas security and access-control standards

### Network boundaries

- Atlas only allows cluster client connections from the project’s **IP access
  list** unless you use private networking.
- IP access lists are **project-wide**, not per cluster.
- Atlas supports **temporary IP access list entries** with configurable
  expiration.
- For application connectivity, Atlas docs call out three main patterns:
  public IP allow-listing, **VPC/VNet peering**, and **private endpoints**.

### Identity boundaries

- **Atlas users** are not the same as **database users**.
- Atlas users access the Atlas control plane; database users access MongoDB
  data-plane resources.
- Database users can be scoped with built-in roles, specific privileges, and
  custom roles.
- Atlas supports multiple database-user auth methods, including **SCRAM** and
  **X.509**, with environment-sensitive guidance in the docs.

### Practical security defaults

1. Prefer **private networking** for higher-security production environments.
2. Prefer **service accounts** for Atlas control-plane automation.
3. Keep API and cluster network allow-lists **narrow** and time-bound where
   possible.
4. Use the **minimum project/organization role** that can perform the task.
5. Keep the distinction between **control-plane auth** and **data-plane auth**
   explicit in design docs and code.

## MongoDB coding standards that still apply on Atlas

### Schema design

- Model data around **application access patterns**.
- Keep data that is accessed together together.
- Use **embedding** when it reduces joins and multi-document coordination.
- Use **referencing** when data has a different access cadence, lifecycle, or
  cardinality profile.

### Query and index design

- Add indexes for repeated query shapes.
- Remember every additional index raises **write cost**.
- Atlas Performance Advisor is useful, but recommended indexes still need human
  judgment about workload frequency and write tradeoffs.
- Large arrays and `$lookup`-heavy designs are called out in Atlas docs as
  common sources of slow-query pain.

### Write and transaction design

- Single-document operations are atomic; many practical designs should exploit
  that instead of defaulting to transactions.
- Include expected current state in update filters or use intent-specific
  operators like `$inc` where concurrency matters.
- Use transactions only when multi-document, multi-collection, or cross-shard
  atomicity is actually required.

### Driver usage

- Production application code should usually target an **official MongoDB
  driver**.
- Atlas expertise includes choosing the right **driver-level behavior** for the
  language/runtime, not only knowing Atlas admin features.

## Search and vector-search standards

### Atlas Search

- Atlas Search is the embedded full-text and relevance-search system for Atlas.
- Search queries are expressed through aggregation pipeline stages such as
  **`$search`** and **`$searchMeta`**.
- Atlas Search supports **analyzers, autocomplete, pagination, faceting,
  scoring, static mappings, and dynamic mappings**.
- Use Atlas Search when the workload is fundamentally about **relevance-based
  text retrieval**.

### Atlas Vector Search

- Atlas Vector Search is the semantic/vector retrieval surface for Atlas.
- Use it for **semantic search, hybrid search, and RAG/agentic retrieval**
  patterns.
- Atlas docs call out **ANN** and **ENN** availability by MongoDB version; do
  not give vector-search guidance without checking version support.
- **Automated Embedding** uses the `autoEmbed` index field type with built-in
  **Voyage AI** models (`voyage-4-large`, `voyage-4`, `voyage-4-lite`,
  `voyage-code-3`) to generate embeddings on insert, update, and query without
  an external pipeline. Public preview as of May 2026. See the refresh section
  below for pricing and model details.

## Backup, reliability, and disaster-recovery standards

Platform-level facts only — for restore procedure, RTO/RPO planning, and DR
runbooks, use `mongodb-operations-expert`.

- Atlas Cloud Backup uses the cloud provider’s native snapshot functionality and
  inherits provider redundancy guarantees.
- Atlas supports **multi-region snapshot distribution** for added redundancy and
  region-failure recovery posture.
- Backup restore/admin operations require the appropriate **project backup**
  roles; org-level access alone is not sufficient until explicitly added to the
  project.
- Topology matters: Atlas docs note restore caveats for sharded clusters after
  shard-count changes.

## Monitoring, alerts, and capacity standards

### Alerts

- Atlas alerts are configured around **conditions, thresholds, notification
  methods, and lifecycle management**.
- Alert policies can exist at the **organization** or **project** level.
- Atlas supports acknowledge/unacknowledge, disable/enable, and delete flows
  for alerts.

### Metrics

- Atlas collects metrics across **servers, databases, and MongoDB processes**.
- High-signal metrics called out in the docs include **connections, disk IOPS,
  disk usage, query targeting, and normalized system CPU**.
- Atlas exposes **real-time metrics** and **Atlas Search metrics** in addition
  to cluster views.

### Capacity and limits

- Atlas limits around **connections, shards, nodes, and topology** are design
  inputs, not just operational trivia.
- Atlas docs explicitly recommend **connection pooling**, application tuning,
  autoscaling, and tier scaling when nearing connection limits.

(Representative methods for each surface are folded into the **Atlas
interaction methods inventory** table above. For the MongoDB data-plane query
layer itself — filters, projections, updates, aggregation pipelines — see
`mongodb-expert`.)

## Practical defaults for future Atlas coding/review tasks

1. Start with **which Atlas surface** the task belongs to: UI, Admin API, CLI,
   Terraform, AKO, or application driver.
2. Separate **Atlas control-plane actions** from **MongoDB data-plane actions**
   before proposing code.
3. For application design, start with **access patterns**, then schema, then
   indexes, then aggregation/search/vector shape.
4. For operations, review **alerts + metrics + limits + backup posture**
   together.
5. For security, review **network path + identity model + required role +
   auth method** together.
6. For AI/search work, choose explicitly between **Atlas Search**, **Atlas
   Vector Search**, or **hybrid** patterns.

## Recent platform changes (2025-2026 refresh)

Dated platform changes since late 2024 — MongoDB 8.0/8.2/8.3 server releases,
the Flex tier migration timeline and limits, Atlas Stream Processing GA, the
Voyage AI acquisition and Automated Embedding, Lexical Prefilters, `$rankFusion`
hybrid search, Search Nodes GA, Queryable Encryption enhancements, Terraform
Provider 2.0, Admin API rate-limiting GA, and Architecture Center/CLI updates —
are enumerated in `references/mongodb-atlas-platform-changelog.md` (last
refreshed 2026-05-25). Read it when a version cutoff, GA date, or pricing
figure is load-bearing; otherwise confirm against the linked official release
notes.

## Known ambiguities and guardrails

- “All Atlas methods” is too large for a single static file. Use this context
  as the **condensed expert map**, then jump to the linked Admin API, CLI,
  driver, and Atlas feature references for exact syntax and complete inventories.
- Atlas docs are **versioned and living**. For vector search, API behavior, CLI
  commands, and limits, always confirm the current version or page timestamp
  when precision matters.
- Atlas advice often differs by **cluster tier, deployment topology, cloud
  provider, and MongoDB version**. Good answers should say which of those
  variables matter.

**High-overlap routing notes:**
- Performance **symptom triage** (high CPU, cache pressure, slow queries, latency spikes) starts at `atlas-diagnostics-expert`, but **storage-engine root-cause internals** (WiredTiger cache fill / dirty trigger / eviction threads / reconciliation / checkpoints) are owned by `mongodb-expert` — cross-load `mongodb-expert/references/mongodb-wiredtiger-internals.md` (and `mongodb-wiredtiger.md`) for depth.
- Migration symptoms vs migration **execution**: live-cluster diagnosis → `atlas-diagnostics-expert`; the migration/mongosync runbook → `mongodb-operations-expert`.
- Atlas Search/Vector **query syntax & index design** → `mongodb-atlas-expert`; the slowness *triage* of a running search → `atlas-diagnostics-expert`.
