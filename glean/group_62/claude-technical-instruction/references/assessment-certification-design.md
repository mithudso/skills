# Assessment & Certification Design

Expert reference for designing, evaluating, and accrediting professional certification programs.
Covers the full lifecycle from job task analysis through psychometric validation, cut-score setting,
exam security, and digital credential issuance. Grounded in AERA/APA/NCME Standards, NCCA/ICE
accreditation requirements, and ANSI/ISO 17024.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Credentialing Lifecycle

Every defensible certification program follows this sequence:

```
Job Task Analysis (JTA)
    ↓
Test Blueprint / Content Outline
    ↓
Item Development (MCQ + PBA)
    ↓
Item Review (Editorial + Sensitivity + SME)
    ↓
Field Testing / Pretesting
    ↓
Psychometric Analysis (CTT + IRT)
    ↓
Standard-Setting (Cut Score)
    ↓
Exam Delivery + Security
    ↓
Ongoing Validity / Reliability Studies
    ↓
Recertification / Credential Maintenance
```

Skipping any step creates a defensibility gap under accreditation review. NCCA Standard 14 requires
documented JTA linkage to every content domain in the blueprint.

### 2. Assessment Blueprint / Test Specifications

The blueprint (also called a table of specifications or content outline) is the governing document
for all item development. It must be empirically traceable to the JTA.

**Blueprint architecture rules (CEDMA guidance):**
- No more than 7 major content domains and 20–22 total objectives
- No single objective should be assessed by only one item (minimum 3–4 items per objective)
- Weight domains proportionally to JTA frequency × importance ratings
- Freeze the blueprint before item development begins; mid-cycle revisions invalidate items

**Cognitive level distribution by certification tier:**

| Tier | Recall (Remember/Understand) | Application (Apply/Analyze) | Synthesis (Evaluate/Create) |
|------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Entry-level | ~70% | ~25% | ~5% |
| Mid-level | ~40% | ~40% | ~20% |
| Advanced/Expert | ~10% | ~40% | ~50% |

Biggs's constructive alignment principle: intended learning outcomes define assessment tasks; tasks
define instructional activities — not the reverse.[^biggs1999] The scenario-removal test: if a candidate can
cover the scenario and answer from the stem alone, the item is testing recall, not reasoning,
regardless of blueprint labeling.[^cedma]

### 3. Item Writing: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs)

See `references/item-writing-and-psychometrics.md` for full distractor analysis tables.

**Well-formed stem rules:**
- Complete problem statement in the stem; candidates should not need to read options to understand the question
- Use positive phrasing; reserve EXCEPT/NOT stems for cases where the negative is the exact professional skill being tested
- One clear question per stem (no double-barreled constructions)
- Avoid window-dressing text that adds length without adding discriminating information

**Distractor design rules:**
- All distractors must be plausible to a candidate lacking the target knowledge
- Options must be parallel in grammatical form and similar in length
- A nonfunctional distractor (selected by <5% of examinees) degrades item discrimination; flag for revision after each administration
- Never use "all of the above" (rewards partial knowledge) or "none of the above" (unless an exact answer is required, e.g., mathematical calculations)

**Six flaw categories to eliminate:**

| Flaw | Mechanism | Fix |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Testwiseness cues | Grammar mismatches, "always/never", longest = correct | Parallel construction; vary correct option length |
| Negative phrasing (EXCEPT/NOT) | Irrelevant processing load | Use only when testing recognition of contraindications |
| All of the above | Rewards knowing 2 of 3 | Eliminate; replace with 4 independent options |
| None of the above | Guessing opportunity in knowledge domains | Eliminate; use only for exact-answer math/spelling |
| Double-barreled stems | Partial knowledge scores correctly | One question per stem |
| Heterogeneous distractors | Options reveal answer by convergence | Ensure options are from the same abstraction level |

Structured faculty training + peer review reduces total item flaw rates from ~67% to ~21% within
three years (longitudinal medical education data).[^pmc3809311]

### 4. Performance-Based Assessment (PBA) Items

PBAs assess execution, not knowledge recall. Action-verb alignment rule:
- Blueprint verbs "configure," "demonstrate," "troubleshoot" → hands-on lab / PBA items
- Blueprint verbs "explain," "identify," "describe" → MCQ or scenario-based items
- Mixing these creates construct-irrelevant variance

**Six-step PBA design process:**
1. Ground each task in a specific JTA task statement
2. Define scoring criteria (success outcomes) before designing the environment
3. Engage SMEs during design, not as final reviewers only
4. Build scoring rubrics concurrently with task design (not post-hoc)
5. Validate each task against actual job performance data
6. Plan ongoing maintenance (tools and duties evolve)

Scoring must accommodate alternative solution paths (multiple valid command sequences achieving the
same correct outcome). Partial-credit rubrics for directionally correct but incomplete solutions.

### 5. Psychometrics: Classical Test Theory (CTT) Item Analysis

Run after every exam administration to flag items for revision or retirement.

**Key statistics and interpretation thresholds:**

| Statistic | Formula / Definition | Acceptable Range | Flag for Review |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Item difficulty (p) | Proportion correct | 0.30–0.70 | <0.20 or >0.90 |
| Point-biserial (r_pbis) | Pearson correlation: item vs. total score | ≥0.30 | <0.20; NEGATIVE = defective item |
| D-index | p(upper 27%) − p(lower 27%) | ≥0.25 | <0.15 |
| Nonfunctional distractor | Chosen by <5% of examinees | — | Any distractor below 5% threshold |
| KR-20 / Cronbach α | Internal consistency (whole test) | ≥0.80 (high-stakes); ≥0.85–0.90 preferred | <0.70 = inadequate for licensure |

**CTT limitation:** all statistics are sample-dependent. The same item's p-value differs across
cohorts with different mean ability.[^ctt-sampledev] This drives the migration to IRT for large-scale programs.

### 6. Psychometrics: Item Response Theory (IRT)

IRT models the probability of a correct response as a function of latent ability (θ) and item
parameters. The key advantage for credentialing: **parameter invariance** — item difficulty does
not depend on who was tested; person ability does not depend on which items were answered.

**Model selection guide:**

| Model | Parameters | When to Use | Sample Size Required |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1PL (Rasch) | Difficulty (b) only | Equal discrimination assumed; European credentialing; small programs | 150–300+ per item |
| 2PL | Difficulty (b) + Discrimination (a) | When item discrimination varies meaningfully | 300–500+ per item |
| 3PL | b + a + Guessing (c) | MCQ exams where guessing occurs; most US high-stakes credentialing | 500–1,000+ per item |

**Key IRT concepts:**
- **Item Characteristic Curve (ICC):** plots P(correct) vs. θ; inflection point = b, slope ∝ a, lower asymptote = c
- **Item Information Function:** I(θ) = a²·P(θ)·Q(θ); items contribute maximum information at θ ≈ b
- **Test Information Function (TIF):** sum of item information functions; enables assembling forms with maximum precision at the cut score
- **Conditional SEM:** SEM(θ) = 1/√I(θ); unlike CTT's global SEM, CSEM varies and is typically largest at the cut score — must be reported for pass/fail decision accuracy

**IRT assumptions to verify:**
1. Unidimensionality (one dominant latent trait; use confirmatory factor analysis)
2. Local independence (items not correlated after conditioning on θ; case vignette testlets violate this)
3. Model fit (fit statistics for each item; misfit → revise or remove)

**Test equating:** when multiple exam forms must be compared fairly, IRT true-score equating with
a Non-Equivalent groups with Anchor Test (NEAT) design is the standard. Anchor item drift (items
that change difficulty between forms due to exposure or coaching) is the primary equating threat.
Pre-equating embeds new items as unscored pilots and calibrates them to the existing scale before
form assembly.

### 7. Standard Setting (Cut Score Determination)

Cut scores must be defensible, documented, and tied to a defined performance standard —
"minimally competent candidate." The standard-setting study is a separate formal process.

**Method comparison:**

| Method | How It Works | Best For | Weakness |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Modified Angoff | SME panelists estimate P(correct) for a "barely passing" candidate per item; mean = cut score | MCQ exams; most common; NCCA-accepted | SME calibration quality determines validity; panelists tend to set scores too high without calibration training |
| Bookmark | Panelists review items ordered by difficulty (from IRT); place a "bookmark" at the last item a passing candidate should get right | IRT-calibrated banks; large programs | Requires IRT item ordering; more psychometrician-intensive |
| Contrasting Groups | Known-competent vs. known-incompetent groups; cut score at intersection of score distributions | When criterion groups are available; validation of other methods | Requires real criterion groups; less applicable for new credentials |

**Standard-setting best practices:**
- Train panelists on the definition of "minimally competent" before ratings (not after)
- Run multiple rounds; show panelists inter-rater disagreement statistics and allow discussion
- Document all panelist credentials, training procedures, and final decisions for accreditation
- Apply SEM at the cut score to define a "borderline zone" for decision accuracy analysis

### 8. Certification Program Design and Accreditation

**ANSI/ISO 17024:2012** — The international standard for personnel certification bodies. Key
requirements: impartiality (governance separation between certification and training arms),
documented examination development, reliability and validity evidence, and a competence-based
appeal process. Required for programs with international recognition ambitions.

**NCCA Standards (National Commission for Certifying Agencies)** — The US-specific accreditation
benchmark administered by ICE (Institute for Credentialing Excellence). 21 Standards organized
around: governance, JTA, exam development, psychometric soundness, security, candidate policies,
and recertification. NCCA accreditation signals program quality to employers and regulators.

**Role separation requirement (both standards):** The governance body that awards credentials must
be structurally independent from any body that provides preparation or training. Conflict-of-interest
management policies must be documented and enforced.

**Recertification / Maintenance of Certification (MOC):**
- CE-based: earn continuing education credits per cycle (most common)
- Point-based: accumulate points across CE, professional activities, contributions
- Re-examination: pass the current exam version at renewal
- Practice requirements: document ongoing professional activity

Choice depends on domain velocity — fast-moving technical domains favor re-examination or
point-based systems that include currency-of-practice requirements.

### 9. Exam Security and Integrity

**Item exposure control:**
- Sympson-Hetter (SH) procedure: assigns probabilistic exposure caps via simulation; prevents
  overexposure in CAT; two-stage SH (2023) adds minimum exposure floor to prevent underexposure
- Item bank rotation: partition banks into sub-banks and rotate active pools; most effective for
  multi-timezone global testing
- Field test items (beta items): embedded unscored items that collect psychometric data without
  affecting candidate score; rotate to operational after calibration

**Online / remote proctoring model comparison:**

| Model | How It Works | Integrity Ceiling | Known Risks |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| AI-only (Proctorio, Honorlock) | Lockdown browser + webcam ML analysis, post-hoc flagging | Moderate | Racial/skin-tone detection bias; disability inequity; false-positive surveillance burden |
| Hybrid AI + live human (ProctorU, Examity) | AI flags anomalies; certified human reviews clips | Higher | Privacy concerns; data sovereignty |
| Live greeter + proctor (Pearson VUE OnVUE) | Human verifies ID + workspace; live proctor throughout | Highest (among remote) | Most resource-intensive; 190-country data compliance |
| Test center | Physical proctored environment | Highest overall | Travel/access barrier; higher cost |

**AI-resistant assessment design (post-LLM era):**

GPT-4-class models score in the 60th–90th percentile on many MCQ credentialing exams. Knowledge
recall items are indefensible without layered countermeasures:

| Countermeasure | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Performance-based items with randomized environment parameters | Real-time tool manipulation; different IP/error state per session | High |
| Oral/viva component (even sampled 20% of candidates) | Real-time follow-up probing; cannot be offloaded to LLM alone | Very high |
| Scenario complexity beyond LLM training data | Current context; multimodal (diagrams, screenshots, equipment) | Medium-high |
| Tight per-question time limits | Reduces LLM consultation opportunity | Medium |
| Item randomization from large pools | Defeats shared answer-key attacks | Medium |
| AI detection tools as screening signal only | High false-positive rates; racial bias documented | Low; never use punitively |

**Key threat vectors (PSI Security Guide):**
1. Content harvesting (phone camera while appearing to face forward) — greatest risk
2. Proxy testing / deepfake video substitution
3. Organized collusion rings across time-zone sittings
4. Brain-dump sites and item-memorization services

### 10. Micro-Credentials, Digital Badges, and Open Badges 3.0

**Differentiation:**
- **Full certification:** comprehensive occupational profile; prerequisites; formal exam; renewal/CE
- **Micro-credential:** discrete skill cluster; short (weeks–months); stackable toward larger qualifications
- **Digital badge:** the visual + metadata artifact representing any achievement (micro or full credential)

**Open Badges 3.0 (1EdTech, final May–June 2024):**[^ob30]
- Each `OpenBadgeCredential` is issued as a W3C Verifiable Credential (VC Data Model 2.0)
- Cryptographically signed by the issuer's DID using **EdDSA (eddsa-rdfc-2022)** or **ECDSA (ecdsa-sd-2023)**
- **Badge Connect API:** OAuth 2.0-authenticated REST endpoints (`getCredentials`, `getProfile`, `upsertCredential`) for credential portability between any compliant platform and any compliant wallet
- Revocation via `BitstringStatusListEntry`; expiration status must be displayed by conformant Displayers
- **CLR Standard 2.0 (Comprehensive Learner Record)** co-evolved with OB 3.0; bundles multiple credentials as a longitudinal transcript

**W3C Verifiable Credentials + DIDs:**
- Issuer signs VC → Holder stores in DID-keyed wallet → Verifier resolves issuer DID, validates signature, checks status — **no callback to issuer required**
- DID v1.0 became W3C Recommendation July 2022
- Blockchain anchoring: credential hash written on-chain; hash mismatch = tamper detection; confidential data stays off-chain
- Verification latency: seconds vs. weeks for legacy background check services

**Employer adoption (verified-as-of: 2026-06-16):** Tech-sector ecosystems (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) have built badge ecosystems with direct employer metadata consumption. Outside tech, employer recognition remains uneven — standards-based portability is the primary mitigation against platform lock-in.
