# Draft → Review → Revise Loop

**Purpose:** a meta-skill that coordinates the three modes of writing work — generating,
evaluating, and improving — in discrete passes with explicit handoff points. The loop
is not infinite. It has stop conditions.

**When invoked by Claude:** produce a structured pass log for each iteration — findings by severity, actions taken, and which stop condition ended the loop. Do not silently revise without showing the iteration record. If the user provides a document, run the loop against it; if they describe a document, ask for the text before proceeding.

**Output shape per iteration:**
1. Review findings list — each finding on its own line with severity label: `[Critical]`, `[High]`, `[Medium]`, or `[Low]`, plus a one-line description
2. Revision summary (what changed, why, keyed to finding IDs)
3. Stop-condition check (which condition applies, or "continuing to iteration N+1")

After completing each loop, re-read the output and confirm it addresses the user's stated goal before delivering it.

## The Three-Pass Discipline

Writing fails in two ways: shipping too early (underdeveloped argument, missing structure)
or never shipping (infinite-polish). The three-pass loop prevents both by separating
incompatible cognitive modes and capping iterations before they become procrastination.

### Pass 1 — Draft

**Mode:** generative. Your job is to get ideas out, not to write well.

Rules:
- **No editing while drafting.** Resist fixing sentences mid-flow. Let ugly prose stand.
  Anne Lamott calls this the "shitty first draft" — a permission slip to write badly so you
  can write at all. The draft's only job is to exist.
- **Mark gaps, don't plug them mid-draft.** Use `[TK]` (to come) or `[GAP: describe what's
  missing]` for unknowns. Stopping to research kills momentum. Fill gaps in Pass 3.
  **Any `[TK]` or `[GAP:]` still present at the end of Pass 3 is a Critical finding — the
  document is not shippable until all markers are resolved or explicitly scoped out.**
- **Time-box.** One Pomodoro — 25 minutes — per major section. If the clock runs out, stop
  mid-sentence and move on. Unfinished prose is not a crisis; it is raw material.
- **Work from an outline, not from instinct.** Even a three-bullet skeleton prevents the
  most common draft failure: a conclusion that argues against the introduction.

See the **Skill Handoff Map** at the end of this document for the full per-phase routing table.

---

### Pass 2 — Review

**Mode:** evaluative. You are now a reader, not the author.

Rules:
- **Read the whole thing once before commenting.** No inline notes on the first pass.
  You need to know where the document goes before you judge any sentence in it.
- **Separate findings by type:**
  - **Missing:** a claim is made but the evidence is absent; a step is assumed but not
    stated; a section promised in the introduction does not appear.
  - **Wrong:** a fact is incorrect; an argument contradicts itself; a structural pattern
    is violated.
  - **Could be better:** prose is clear enough but could be sharper, shorter, or better
    ordered.
- **Name the framework you are reviewing against.** Do not review in a vacuum. Pick one
  and be explicit:
  - BLUF — does the bottom line appear in the first sentence?
  - MECE — are sections mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive?
  - Minto Pyramid — does the argument flow deductively from a single governing idea?
  - PARA — is the document in the right context (project, area, resource, or archive)?
  - SCQA — is the Situation / Complication / Question / Answer arc intact?
- **Severity-label every finding:** Critical (document is wrong or misleading), High
  (missing material the audience needs), Medium (structure or argument weakness), Low
  (style preference, nice-to-have).
- **Do not fix during review.** Record findings. Mixing evaluation and correction corrupts
  both modes — you stop seeing what is actually there.

---

### Pass 3 — Revise

**Mode:** surgical. Apply the review findings against a priority threshold.

Rules:
- **Address every Critical and High finding.** These are not optional. If a Critical
  finding cannot be resolved, the document is not ready to ship — restart or descope.
- **Batch Medium findings.** Group related Medium findings and address them in one pass
  through the affected section. Avoid thrashing individual sentences.
- **Skip Low findings unless trivial.** A Low finding that takes thirty seconds to fix
  is worth taking. A Low finding that requires restructuring a paragraph is not worth
  taking on the first revision cycle — bank it for the next iteration if it recurs.
- **Do not introduce new content during revision.** If revision uncovers a missing
  section, that section goes back to draft mode (Pass 1), not inline into the revision
  pass. Keep the modes clean.
- **Log what changed and why.** One-line entry per finding resolved:
  `[H] §3 — added missing latency data; source: internal benchmark doc`.

See the **Skill Handoff Map** at the end of this document for routing after revision.

## Stop Conditions

The loop ends when the first applicable condition is met — earliest wins.

| Condition | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Hard stop** | 3 full iterations (draft → review → revise counts as 1). No exceptions. If 3 iterations have not produced a shippable document, the problem is scope or premise, not prose. |
| **Soft stop** | The most recent review pass has no Medium-or-higher findings. Ship. |
| **Time-box stop** | Total revision effort (Pass 2 + Pass 3 across all iterations) exceeds 50% of the original draft effort — measured in wall-clock time for human authors, or in iteration count for AI-assisted work (default: if revision iterations exceed half the original draft's section count, flag and stop). A document that costs more to revise than to write has a structural problem, not an editing problem. |
| **Convergence stop** | Net word-count change between the most recent revision and the prior one is less than 5% of total document word count. You are polishing grooves, not improving the document. |

If you reach the hard stop without reaching soft stop, ship the best available version
with a known-issues note, or escalate the scope problem. Infinite iteration is not a
quality strategy.

## The 24-Hour Cooling-Off Rule

Stephen King recommends letting a draft rest before revising. The principle: you cannot
read what you wrote — you read what you meant to write. Distance corrects that.

For documents under 500 words: 1–2 hours is sufficient.
For documents 500–2,000 words: overnight.
For documents over 2,000 words: 24 hours minimum.

If the deadline prevents cooling off, use the **fresh eyes** pattern instead.

---

## The Fresh Eyes Pattern

If you cannot wait, get a different reviewer for iteration N+1 than for iteration N.
The first reviewer has already accommodated your argument; they will find it harder to
see what is still missing. A second reviewer reads with no accommodation debt.

Applied to Claude: ask a second agent session (or invoke document-critique with a cold
context) rather than asking the same session that helped draft to also review.

---

## Per-Iteration Log

Keep a running log for every document that goes through more than one cycle.

```
## Revision log — [Document title]

### Iteration 1
- Draft completed: [date/time]
- Reviewed by: [agent or name], framework: [BLUF / MECE / etc.]
- Findings: 2 Critical, 3 High, 4 Medium, 1 Low
- Revisions applied: [brief list]
- Stop check: High findings remain — continue

### Iteration 2
- Draft completed: [date/time]
- Reviewed by: [different reviewer], framework: [BLUF / MECE / etc.]
- Findings: 0 Critical, 0 High, 2 Medium, 3 Low
- Revisions applied: [brief list]
- Stop check: No Medium-or-higher findings — SOFT STOP, ship
```

## Anti-Patterns

**Editing while drafting.** Kills generative momentum. You end up with the first three
paragraphs polished and the rest unwritten. Lamott diagnosed this decades ago; the fix
is the same: write badly first.

**Infinite polishing.** Zinsser: "Rewriting is the essence of writing well — but there
is a difference between rewriting that improves and rewriting that avoids." Apply the
convergence and time-box stop conditions ruthlessly.

**Five-stakeholder review before any iteration.** Gathering input from five people on a
first draft means gathering five reactions to a document that will change dramatically
anyway. Get to iteration 2 before widening the reviewer pool.

**No time-box on review.** A review pass without a time-box expands to fill all available
attention. Cap each review pass at half the draft time or 30 minutes, whichever is less.

**Skipping the framework.** Reviewing without a named framework produces impressionistic
feedback ("this feels off") that is hard to act on. Name the lens before you start.

---

## When to Bail Entirely

Iteration is not always the answer. Stop the loop and start over when:

- **Scope changed.** The document is now answering a different question than it started
  with. Revising toward a moving target produces incoherent documents.
- **Audience changed.** A document written for engineers and redirected to executives
  needs a new draft, not another revision pass.
- **Premise was wrong.** The core argument has been disproven or superseded. No amount
  of revision fixes a document whose central claim is no longer true.

In all three cases: close the log, open a new one, and return to Pass 1. The old draft
is not wasted — it is a source of raw material and a record of what the argument was.
