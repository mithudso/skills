# Reasoning Models & Test-Time Compute

The frontier (2024–2026) shift from "scale the model and prompt it well" to "**train the model to reason, then spend extra compute at inference to reason harder**." Two coupled ideas drive it:

1. **Test-time / inference-time compute (TTC):** a model can be made more accurate on a hard problem by spending *more compute when answering* — sampling many solutions, searching over reasoning steps, or generating a long internal chain of thought — instead of (or in addition to) growing the model. Snell et al. (2024) showed this can be **more parameter-efficient than scaling pretraining** on a fixed compute budget for many problems.
2. **Reasoning models** (o1/o3, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini "thinking", Claude extended thinking): models *post-trained with reinforcement learning to produce long chains of thought before answering*. The RL teaches the model to use its inference budget well, so the two ideas reinforce each other: the model both *generates* a long CoT and *benefits* from being allowed to.

## Scope boundary (read first)

- **This reference** = the model's *reasoning*: long-CoT, reasoning-specific RL (GRPO, RLVR), process vs outcome reward models, test-time-compute scaling (best-of-N, self-consistency, search), inference-time scaling laws, the o-series/R1 landscape, budget forcing, reasoning distillation, reasoning benchmarks, and the cost/latency/accuracy trade-off.
- **Classic preference alignment** — RLHF with PPO, the DPO-variant family (DPO/IPO/KTO/ORPO/SimPO/CPO), RLAIF, Constitutional AI — is a **different objective** (match human *preference* via a learned reward model). It lives in `references/llm-alignment-post-training.md`. The line: **reasoning-RL optimizes *verifiable correctness*; alignment-RL optimizes *human preference*.** GRPO/RLVR-for-reasoning are here; the same algorithms used for preference tuning are there.
- **Agent loops / tool use** (a model calling tools in a multi-step loop) → `references/agent-ecosystem.md`, `references/autonomous-loops.md`, `references/agent-harness-construction.md`. This reference is about the *model's own* reasoning, not the orchestration around it. (Reasoning models *can* call tools mid-thought — "agentic reasoning" — but the orchestration belongs to those references.)
- **Serving throughput** (vLLM batching, speculative decoding, KV-cache) → `references/llm-inference-serving.md`. Speculative decoding *speeds up* token generation; it is not test-time *scaling* (spending more compute to get a better answer). Don't conflate them.
- **Model selection / the landscape** (which model to pick) → `references/llm-models.md`; this reference covers the *reasoning-specific* properties of those models. **Offline benchmark mechanics** (HELM/MMLU harness internals) → `da-7-machine-learning` (`da-analytical-methods`).

## 1. Chain-of-thought (CoT) and long-CoT

**Chain-of-thought prompting** (Wei et al., NeurIPS 2022, arXiv:2201.11903) is the origin: prompting a model to emit *intermediate reasoning steps* before its final answer ("Let's think step by step" / few-shot exemplars with worked reasoning) sharply improves arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. The paper's key empirical claim: CoT is an **emergent ability of scale** — it does not help (and can hurt) small models, and only yields gains at roughly ≥100B-parameter scale. CoT works because autoregressive decoding lets the model **externalize computation into tokens**: each generated step conditions the next, so the model can do serial work it cannot do in a single forward pass. A useful mental model is that CoT trades extra output tokens for extra effective "depth."

**Long-CoT** is the 2024–2026 evolution. Where prompted CoT produces a few tidy steps, reasoning models produce **thousands of tokens of unpolished internal reasoning** — exploring, backtracking, self-correcting, re-checking ("Wait, let me reconsider…"), trying multiple approaches. This is not just "more steps"; it qualitatively includes **reflection, verification, and search-like behavior in a single linear stream**. DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibited a now-famous **"aha moment"**: mid-training, the model spontaneously learned to stop and re-evaluate its approach, allocating more thinking to harder sub-problems — an emergent behavior from RL, not something explicitly taught. Long-CoT is what reasoning-model RL *produces*, and what makes test-time-compute scaling work: a longer, self-correcting chain is more likely to reach the right answer.

**CoT faithfulness caveat:** the visible chain is not guaranteed to be the model's true computation. Models can reach a correct answer via a reasoning trace that is post-hoc or partially confabulated, so a CoT should be treated as *an aid to accuracy*, not *a transparent log of mechanism* — relevant for both interpretability and safety.

## 2. Reinforcement learning for reasoning — GRPO and the DeepSeek-R1 recipe

The central insight of reasoning models: **you can RL a base model toward better reasoning using only an automatic correctness signal** (does the final answer match? does the code pass tests?), with no human preference labels and no learned reward model. This is what separates reasoning-RL from RLHF.

### GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)

GRPO (introduced in **DeepSeekMath**, arXiv:2402.03300; used at scale in R1) is the workhorse algorithm. It is a PPO-style policy-gradient method that **removes the value/critic network**. Instead of a learned baseline, GRPO samples a **group of G outputs** for each prompt, scores them all with the reward function, and uses the **group's mean reward as the baseline** — each sample's advantage is its reward standardized against its group (`(r_i − mean) / std`). Benefits: no critic model (roughly halves memory/compute vs PPO's four-model loop), and a baseline that is naturally calibrated per-prompt. It keeps PPO's clipped surrogate objective and a **KL penalty to a reference policy** to prevent drift. Known issue: the original formulation can induce a **response-length bias** (especially inflating length on *incorrect* answers); several 2025 variants (e.g., length-normalized / token-level objectives, Dr. GRPO) correct this.

### The R1-Zero and R1 recipe (arXiv:2501.12948)

- **DeepSeek-R1-Zero** = pure RL, *no SFT at all*, applied directly to a base model (DeepSeek-V3-Base) with GRPO and **rule-based rewards** (accuracy reward for verifiable answers + format reward for putting reasoning in `<think>` tags). Powerful reasoning **emerged from RL alone** — the model taught itself long-CoT, reflection, and the "aha moment." But R1-Zero had poor readability and **language mixing** (switching languages mid-thought).
- **DeepSeek-R1** fixes this with a **multi-stage pipeline**:
  1. **Cold-start SFT** — fine-tune the base on a small set of curated long-CoT examples to give a readable starting point.
  2. **Reasoning-oriented RL** — large-scale GRPO with verifiable rewards (plus a language-consistency reward to stop language mixing).
  3. **Rejection-sampling SFT** — generate many samples from the RL checkpoint, keep the correct/readable ones, add general-purpose data, and SFT a fresh checkpoint.
  4. **Final RL** — a second RL stage over both reasoning and general (helpfulness/harmlessness) prompts.

  Result: R1 matched OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning while being openly published. The recipe — **small cold-start SFT → verifiable-reward RL → rejection-sample SFT → RL again** — is now the canonical open template for building a reasoning model. (For the *preference*-alignment side of post-training — reward modeling, RLHF/PPO, DPO — see `llm-alignment-post-training.md`.)

## 3. RLVR — Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards

**RLVR** (named and formalized in **Tülu 3**, Lambert et al., arXiv:2411.15124) is the general principle behind reasoning-RL: **replace RLHF's learned reward model with a deterministic verification function**, and give reward *only when the output is verifiably correct*. The verifier can be an exact-match check on a math answer, a unit-test suite for code, a format/constraint checker for instruction-following, or a symbolic checker. Because the signal is grounded truth rather than a learned proxy, RLVR is **far less prone to reward hacking** than RLHF — there is no reward model to exploit (though *verifier* gaming and reward-spec gaps still exist).

- **Scope:** RLVR works wherever correctness is cheaply checkable — math, code, logic, structured output. It does **not** directly apply to open-ended generation (essays, dialogue) where there is no verifier; that remains preference-alignment territory. A 2026 line of work ("verifiable reference-based rewards") tries to extend RLVR-style signals to open-ended tasks via reference answers.
- **Algorithm-agnostic:** RLVR is the *reward design*; the *optimizer* can be PPO (Tülu 3) or GRPO (R1). Don't conflate "RLVR" (verifiable reward) with "GRPO" (critic-free optimizer) — they're orthogonal and often combined.

### The RLVR effectiveness debate (important, unresolved as of mid-2026)

A prominent 2025 result (Yue et al., Tsinghua, arXiv:2504.13837) argued that RLVR may **not teach genuinely new reasoning** — under pass@k with large k, RLVR-trained models do not exceed the *base* model's coverage of solvable problems; RL appears to **sharpen / up-weight reasoning paths already in the base distribution** (raising pass@1) rather than discovering paths the base could never find. Follow-ups (e.g., arXiv:2506.14245) counter that RLVR *implicitly improves* the correctness of sampled reasoning. The practical takeaway: **RLVR reliably makes a model better at *finding* its good reasoning faster (sample-efficiency / pass@1), but whether it expands the reasoning *ceiling* beyond the base model is contested** — relevant when deciding between RL and just distilling from a stronger teacher (§7).

---

## 4. Process reward models (PRM) vs outcome reward models (ORM)

When you score reasoning, you can reward the **outcome** (final answer only) or the **process** (each intermediate step). This choice shapes both RL training and test-time verification.

- **ORM (Outcome Reward Model):** one scalar for the whole solution, based on final-answer correctness. Cheap to label (just check the answer), but gives **sparse, delayed credit** — a solution with a fatal error in step 2 that luckily reaches the right answer is rewarded; the model cannot localize *where* it went wrong.
- **PRM (Process Reward Model):** scores **each reasoning step** as correct/helpful or not. Originated in OpenAI's **"Let's Verify Step by Step"** (Lightman et al., 2023), which released **PRM800K** (800K human step-level labels on MATH solutions). Their headline result: **process supervision trains substantially more reliable verifiers than outcome supervision** — a PRM-reranked solver solved **78.2%** of a representative MATH subset, beating ORM reranking. PRMs give **dense credit assignment** and **interpretability** (you see which step failed).

**Two uses of reward models — keep them distinct:**
1. **As a training signal** (in RL): PRMs can densify the RL reward. *However*, the R1 team found PRMs hard to use as the RL reward at scale — defining "a good step" is fuzzy, step-level labels are expensive, and PRMs are themselves **reward-hackable**. R1 therefore used simple **rule-based outcome+format rewards** for RL, not a PRM. This is a key practical lesson: **PRMs shine at test-time verification more than as the RL objective.**
2. **As a test-time verifier** (§5–6): a PRM scores candidate solutions/steps so search or best-of-N can pick the best — this is where PRMs deliver the most value.

The **PRM survey** (arXiv:2510.08049) traces the field from outcome signals to process supervision and covers automatic PRM-label generation (e.g., Monte-Carlo rollouts that label a step by how often continuing from it reaches a correct answer — "Math-Shepherd" style), which removes the human-labeling bottleneck.

---

## 5. Parallel test-time compute — best-of-N, self-consistency, verifiers

The simplest way to spend more inference compute: **sample multiple independent solutions and aggregate**. This is "parallel" scaling (independent samples) as opposed to "sequential" scaling (one long, self-correcting chain — §9).

- **Self-consistency** (Wang et al., 2022, arXiv:2203.11171): sample N diverse CoT paths with temperature > 0, then **take the majority-vote final answer** (marginalizing over reasoning paths). Requires no extra model — just the solver — and reliably beats greedy single-path CoT. The canonical, cheapest TTC method for tasks with a discrete answer. Diminishing returns set in as N grows (gains are roughly logarithmic in N).
- **Best-of-N (BoN) with a verifier/reward model:** sample N solutions, **score each with an ORM/PRM (or a generative verifier)**, and return the highest-scored one. Unlike majority vote, BoN can pick a *minority-but-correct* answer if the verifier recognizes it — so it scales better when a good verifier exists. **Weighted best-of-N** combines both: weight votes by verifier score.
- **Generative verifiers (GenRM, arXiv:2408.15240):** instead of a scalar reward head, train the verifier to *generate* a correctness judgment as next-token prediction ("Is this correct? Yes/No" with its own CoT). This lets the verifier itself **use CoT and its own test-time compute** (e.g., majority-vote the verdict), giving 16–40% more problems solved at BoN on math/algorithmic tasks vs a discriminative ORM.
- **Self-certainty / confidence-based selection** (arXiv:2502.18581): use the model's *own* output-distribution confidence to rank the N samples — a verifier-free BoN proxy that scales without a reward model.

**Verifier quality is the ceiling on BoN.** A weak verifier makes BoN plateau or even degrade as N grows (you increasingly select confidently-wrong answers — "reward over-optimization" at inference). With a perfect verifier (e.g., unit tests for code), BoN is extremely strong: pass@N rises steeply.

---

## 6. Search-based test-time compute — beam, lookahead, MCTS, reward-guided decoding

Beyond independent samples, you can **search over the space of reasoning steps**, using a process verifier to guide which partial paths to expand. The tree-search-for-reasoning survey (arXiv:2510.09988) unifies these.

- **Step-level beam search:** expand the solution step-by-step; at each step sample several continuations, score partial paths with a **PRM**, and keep the top-`b` (beam width). Spends compute on promising prefixes instead of full independent rollouts.
- **Lookahead search:** at each step, roll out a few steps ahead (or to completion) to estimate a partial path's value before committing — more accurate per-step scoring, more compute per step.
- **MCTS-style search** (e.g., **ReST-MCTS\***, rStar, AlphaZero-flavored methods): build a search tree of reasoning steps with selection (UCT), expansion, simulation, and backpropagation of value estimates. A process reward / value model guides exploration vs exploitation. MCTS is the most compute-intensive but, with a good value model, the most sample-efficient for very hard problems; it also **generates high-quality process labels** for self-training (the search finds good trajectories you then SFT/RL on).
- **Reward-guided / verifier-guided decoding:** more generally, steer token- or step-level generation with a reward/value signal so the decode itself favors high-reward continuations.

**When search beats best-of-N (Snell et al., 2024):** on **easier** problems, simple best-of-N / sequential revision is compute-optimal; on **harder** problems, **search (beam/lookahead) over a PRM** uses the budget better. The optimal strategy is **difficulty-dependent** — there is no single best TTC method (§7). Caveat: much of the strongest search work uses small models + strong PRMs on math; with a top-tier reasoning model that already does long-CoT, a long single chain plus self-consistency often matches elaborate external search at lower engineering cost.

---

## 7. Inference-time scaling laws and compute-optimal test-time scaling

Just as pretraining has scaling laws, **inference has scaling laws**: accuracy improves predictably as you spend more test-time compute, up to a point.

- **Inference Scaling Laws** (Wu et al., 2024, arXiv:2408.00724): for a fixed *inference* compute budget, there is an **optimal model size** — and it is often **smaller than you'd pick for single-shot use**. A smaller model run with more samples/search can beat a larger model run once, at equal inference FLOPs. Error rates fall smoothly with inference compute, and the **compute-optimal model size shifts smaller as the inference budget grows**.
- **Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling** (Snell et al., 2024, arXiv:2408.03314): the headline result — **optimally allocating test-time compute can be more effective than scaling model parameters.** The two main TTC "knobs" are (a) **refining the proposal distribution** (sequential revisions — the model edits its own answer) and (b) **searching against a verifier** (PRM-guided beam/best-of-N). Crucially, the **best knob depends on prompt difficulty**: easy → sequential revision; hard → search. They define a **"compute-optimal" scaling strategy** that picks the knob per-difficulty, and show that under it a smaller model + TTC can **match a ~14× larger model** on some problem distributions.
- **TTC vs pretraining is not free lunch:** Snell et al. also note the trade is **problem-dependent and bounded** — on the hardest problems beyond a base model's reach, *no* amount of TTC closes the gap; you need a stronger base model. And a 2026 result ("Test-Time Scaling Makes Overtraining Compute-Optimal," arXiv:2604.01411) shows the optimal *pretraining* recipe shifts once you account for downstream TTC. **Practical rule:** TTC buys the most on problems within a model's reach that it gets wrong by *under*-thinking; it cannot manufacture capability the base model lacks.

---

## 8. The reasoning-model landscape — the o-series, R1-class, and mid-2026 SOTA

- **OpenAI o-series** — **o1** (late 2024) launched the category: "trained with RL to think before answering" with a long hidden CoT; the *reasoning tokens are not shown* to the user (summarized only). **o3 / o4-mini** (system card, Apr 16 2025) scaled the RL and added **native tool use inside the reasoning loop** (browsing, Python, image analysis). Key dial: **reasoning effort** (`low`/`medium`/`high`, e.g. `o4-mini-high`) trades latency/cost for accuracy; OpenAI confirmed performance keeps climbing with more inference-time reasoning. o1/o3 are the proprietary reference points; R1 is the open one.
- **DeepSeek-R1 / R1-Zero** (Jan 2025) — the first openly published o1-class reasoning model, MIT-licensed, with the full recipe (§2) and **R1-Distill** checkpoints (§10). It made the entire reasoning-RL recipe reproducible and triggered the open-reasoning wave.
- **Hybrid "thinking" models** — rather than ship a separate reasoning model, the major labs added a **toggleable thinking mode** to general models, with an explicit **thinking budget**:
  - **Gemini 2.5** (Pro/Flash, 2025) — "thinking models" with a developer-set **thinking budget** (0 disables thinking; up to tens of thousands of tokens). Thinking tokens are billed as output.
  - **Claude extended thinking** — a `thinking` block with a developer-set **budget_tokens** (min 1,024); Anthropic recommends starting at the minimum and raising it. Visible (summarized) thinking, billed as output tokens.
  - **Qwen / other open families** ship "thinking" variants and hybrid toggles.
- **Mid-2026 SOTA (directional — version numbers move monthly).** As of mid-2026 the frontier is a **three-way race** (OpenAI GPT-5.x, Google Gemini 3.x, Anthropic Claude Opus 4.x), all reasoning/thinking models, with **GPQA-Diamond saturating in the low-to-mid 90s%** and **AIME 2025 effectively solved** by the top models (≈95% no-tools, ~100% with code execution). No single model dominates — each leads a different problem shape (math/science vs agentic coding vs abstract reasoning like ARC-AGI-2). The reliable signal isn't the leaderboard number (benchmarks saturate, §11) but the *shape*: every frontier model now ships long-CoT reasoning with a controllable compute budget. **Anchor exact figures to the primary system cards/papers, not to secondary blog roundups** (version labels and headline numbers in those vary).

---

## 9. Budget forcing and thinking-token control

Once a model produces long-CoT, you need a **dial on how much it thinks**. Two layers:

- **API-level thinking budget** (production): set a max thinking-token budget per request (Gemini `thinkingBudget`, Claude `budget_tokens`, OpenAI `reasoning_effort`). Higher budget → better on hard problems, but **more latency and cost** (thinking tokens are billed, usually at output rates). Lower/zero budget for easy tasks (fact lookup, classification) where reasoning is wasted (§12).
- **Budget forcing** (research technique, **s1**, Muennighoff et al., 2025, arXiv:2501.19393): a remarkably simple way to *control and extend* test-time compute by editing the decode:
  - **To cap thinking:** force-append the end-of-thinking delimiter + a "Final Answer:" cue, making the model stop and commit.
  - **To extend thinking:** when the model tries to end its thinking, **suppress the end token and append "Wait"** (one or more times). The model continues — often **catching and fixing its own errors** on the extra pass. This is **sequential** test-time scaling (one chain made longer), which the s1 authors find scales more cleanly than parallel sampling for a fixed budget.
  - **s1 result:** SFT **Qwen2.5-32B on just 1,000 curated reasoning traces (s1K)** — selected for *difficulty, diversity, quality* — plus budget forcing yields **s1-32B**, which **exceeds o1-preview on AIME24/MATH by up to 27%**, and budget forcing **extrapolates AIME24 from 50%→57%** by simply forcing more "Wait"s. The headline lesson of s1: **a tiny amount of high-quality long-CoT SFT + a test-time control knob recovers much of the reasoning gain** — reasoning ability is substantially *elicited*, not only *trained in* with massive RL.
- **Overthinking / underthinking** are the failure modes of the dial (§12).

---

## 10. Distilling reasoning into smaller models

You don't have to *RL* a small model to make it reason — you can **distill** a big reasoning model's long-CoT into a smaller one via plain SFT on its traces.

- **DeepSeek-R1-Distill** (released with R1): generate **~800K reasoning samples from R1**, then **SFT** them into smaller bases — **Qwen** (1.5B/7B/14B/32B) and **Llama** (8B/70B). **No RL stage** on the small model — just supervised fine-tuning on the teacher's traces.
- **Headline finding (decision-relevant):** **distillation beats running RL directly on the small model.** DeepSeek showed that R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (e.g., **72.6% pass@1 AIME 2024**, **94.3% MATH-500**) **outperforms** trying to RL that same 32B from scratch — and even beats much larger *non-reasoning* models (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet of that era) on reasoning benchmarks. **The practical rule: if a strong reasoning teacher exists, distill from it before spending compute on RL for a small model.** RL pays off mainly at the frontier (where no stronger teacher exists). This connects to the §3 debate: if RLVR mostly *sharpens* base-distribution paths, a teacher that already found those paths can transfer them cheaply by SFT.
- **Caveats:** the student inherits the teacher's *failure modes* and *style* (verbosity, language quirks); distillation transfers what the teacher can do, not beyond it; license terms on teacher outputs matter. (For the broader compression toolkit — quantization, pruning, merging — see `llm-compression.md`; this section is specifically about distilling *reasoning behavior*.)

---

## 11. Reasoning benchmarks — and why they keep breaking

Reasoning models are evaluated on **verifiable, hard** tasks (so RLVR/verifier signals apply):

- **AIME (2024/2025):** 30 competition-math problems with integer answers 000–999 — the canonical hard-math reasoning eval. Small N (30 problems) makes single runs **high-variance**; report **pass@1 averaged over many seeds** (e.g., avg@32), not a single attempt.
- **MATH / MATH-500:** competition math; **largely saturated** by frontier reasoning models (>94%), so it now mainly separates mid-tier models.
- **GPQA-Diamond:** ~198 **graduate-level, Google-proof** science questions (bio/chem/physics) written by domain experts — a reasoning eval resistant to lookup. Approaching saturation at the frontier (low-to-mid 90s%) but still discriminates the 60–90% band.
- **LiveCodeBench** (arXiv:2403.07974): **contamination-free** competitive-programming eval — every problem is **timestamped by release date**, so you can evaluate a model **only on problems published after its training cutoff**, defeating memorization. The gold standard for *honest* code-reasoning numbers. (A harder "LiveCodeBench Pro" curated by olympiad medalists, arXiv:2506.11928, pushes the frontier.)

**Evaluation hygiene (treat as the real lesson):**
- **Contamination & saturation** are the dominant threats. Legacy benchmarks (MATH, GPQA) saturate within a model generation or two, and static test sets leak into training corpora. Prefer **time-gated / live** benchmarks (LiveCodeBench), **freshly authored** sets (AIME each year), and **contamination-mitigation** synthesis (arXiv:2509.00072).
- **pass@1 vs pass@k:** pass@1 measures single-shot accuracy (what users get); pass@k measures *coverage* (whether the model *can* solve it in k tries) — the §3 RLVR debate hinges on the gap between them. Report both when claiming RL "improved reasoning."
- **Variance:** on tiny sets like AIME, always average many samples; a single pass@1 is noise.
- **Tools vs no-tools:** "100% AIME with code execution" ≠ "100% innate math." State the tool condition.

---

## 12. Cost, latency, and accuracy trade-offs (the operating decision)

Reasoning is **expensive**: thinking tokens are billed (usually at output rates) and **dominate latency** — a hard query can burn tens of thousands of hidden tokens before the first visible output. The engineering job is allocating that budget.

- **Route by difficulty.** Don't pay for reasoning on easy tasks. Use a cheap/non-thinking model (or `reasoning_effort: low` / `thinkingBudget: 0`) for retrieval, classification, formatting, simple Q&A; reserve high thinking budgets for genuinely hard math/code/planning. A router or a difficulty classifier in front of the model captures most of the savings.
- **Tune the budget empirically.** Accuracy vs budget is a **concave curve with sharply diminishing returns** — there's a knee beyond which extra thinking adds cost/latency but little accuracy. Sweep the budget on a representative eval set and pick the knee, per task type. Anthropic's guidance (start at the 1,024-token minimum and increase) operationalizes this.
- **Overthinking** = the model burns budget on easy problems, second-guesses a correct answer into a wrong one, or loops. **Underthinking** = budget too low, model commits before it has worked the problem. Both are real failure modes; budget control (§9) is the lever.
- **The "thinking-token trap":** thinking tokens count against `max_tokens`/output budget and can **silently consume the whole budget before any answer is emitted** — set thinking and answer budgets separately and monitor reasoning-token usage as a first-class cost metric.
- **TTC vs a bigger model (cost framing):** §7's scaling laws are also a *cost* argument — a smaller reasoning model with a tuned budget can be **cheaper at equal accuracy** than a larger single-shot model on many workloads, but only within the smaller model's capability ceiling. Benchmark both on *your* traffic.
- **Caching & latency mitigation:** prompt/prefix caching (see `llm-inference-serving.md`) cuts the *input* cost of long reasoning prompts but not the thinking-token cost; streaming the thinking summary improves perceived latency.

---

## Practical patterns

- **Building a reasoning model (open recipe):** start from the **R1 template** — small cold-start long-CoT SFT → **GRPO with rule-based verifiable rewards** (accuracy + format) → rejection-sample SFT → final RL. Use a **length-corrected GRPO variant** to avoid length bias. Add a **language-consistency reward** if you see language mixing.
- **Cheapest path to a reasoning small model:** **distill** (SFT on a strong teacher's traces, §10) before attempting RL. Try **s1-style** tiny-but-curated SFT (1K high-quality traces) + budget forcing first — it's astonishingly strong for the cost.
- **Squeezing more accuracy at inference without retraining:** (1) **self-consistency** (majority vote over N samples) if the answer is discrete and you have no verifier; (2) **best-of-N with a verifier** (unit tests for code; PRM/GenRM for math) if a verifier exists; (3) **PRM-guided beam/lookahead search** for the hardest problems; (4) **budget forcing / raise the thinking budget** for sequential scaling. Pick by **difficulty** (Snell): easy → revise/self-consistency; hard → search.
- **Verifier first.** Most TTC value comes from a good verifier. For code, your verifier is **tests** — invest there. For math, a **GenRM** or PRM. A weak verifier caps best-of-N and can make it *worse* at large N.
- **Operate it:** route by difficulty, sweep the budget to the knee, treat reasoning tokens as a first-class cost/latency metric, separate thinking and answer budgets.

## Anti-patterns

- **Treating the visible CoT as ground-truth mechanism** — it can be unfaithful/post-hoc; don't build safety or audit guarantees on raw CoT (§1).
- **Conflating speculative decoding with test-time scaling** — speculative decoding makes tokens *faster*; TTC spends *more* compute for a *better* answer. Different goals; one is in `llm-inference-serving.md` (§Scope).
- **Conflating RLHF/DPO with reasoning-RL** — different objective (preference vs verifiable correctness). Use `llm-alignment-post-training.md` for the former.
- **Using a PRM as the RL reward by default** — R1's lesson: PRMs are reward-hackable and fuzzy to define as an RL signal; prefer **rule-based outcome+format rewards for RL**, and **save the PRM for test-time verification** (§4).
- **Cranking the thinking budget globally** — pays cost/latency on easy traffic and risks overthinking; route by difficulty and tune to the knee (§12).
- **Assuming RLVR creates new capability** — contested (§3); it reliably improves pass@1 sample-efficiency but may only sharpen base-distribution reasoning. If a stronger teacher exists, distill (§10).
- **Trusting saturated/contaminated benchmarks** — MATH/GPQA saturate; static sets leak. Use time-gated/live evals and report pass@1 over many seeds with the tool condition stated (§11).
- **Best-of-N with a weak verifier at large N** — selects confidently-wrong answers; verifier quality is the ceiling (§5).

## Troubleshooting

- **Reasoning model gives no/empty answer, or truncates mid-thought** → thinking tokens consumed the entire output budget ("thinking-token trap"). Raise/separate `max_tokens` from the thinking budget; monitor reasoning-token counts (§12).
- **Long-CoT model switches languages / unreadable** → R1-Zero symptom; add cold-start SFT and a **language-consistency reward**, or use the distilled (R1-Distill) variant which is cleaner (§2, §10).
- **RL reasoning training: responses keep getting longer with no accuracy gain** → GRPO length bias; switch to a length-normalized/token-level GRPO variant (Dr. GRPO-style) (§2).
- **Best-of-N stops helping (or degrades) as N grows** → verifier is too weak (reward over-optimization at inference). Improve the verifier (tests for code; GenRM for math) or fall back to self-consistency (§5).
- **Small model won't learn to reason under RL** → expected; RL on small models is sample-hungry and may not exceed the base ceiling. **Distill from a stronger teacher instead** (§10, §3).
- **High cost/latency in production** → route by difficulty, drop the budget to the empirical knee, disable thinking on easy intents, cache long prompt prefixes (§12).
- **AIME/benchmark score swings run-to-run** → tiny test set; average pass@1 over many seeds (avg@k); don't report a single attempt (§11).
