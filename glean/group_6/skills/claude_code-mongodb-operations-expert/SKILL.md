# MongoDB Operations Expert

The operations, reliability, and data-movement hub for MongoDB and Atlas. This
skill covers the parts of running MongoDB that sit *around* the data plane:
keeping data safe (backup, restore, point-in-time recovery, disaster recovery),
moving data (migration patterns, mongosync live migration, Relational Migrator,
CDC, Kafka and Spark connectors), governing data (lifecycle, archival, security
architecture, encryption, compliance), and controlling spend (cost
optimization). It spans both Atlas-managed and self-managed deployments, plus
the Ops Manager / Cloud Manager control planes that automate them.

Use it when the task is about reliability or data movement rather than writing
queries, designing Atlas platform features, or diagnosing a live cluster. For a
single deep sub-area, match the routing table below and read the corresponding
reference file before answering.

## How to use this skill

This skill consolidates 16 MongoDB operations sub-skills as on-demand reference
files. Match the task to the routing table below and **Read the listed
`references/…md` file before answering deep questions** — the table alone is not
enough for depth. For exact command, option, version, and endpoint details,
defer to the official MongoDB Manual, Atlas docs, and connector docs as the
source of truth.

## Sub-skill routing table

This hub absorbs 16 former standalone skills plus 2 researched architecture references (18 total) as on-demand reference files. When a
task matches a row, **Read the listed `references/` file** before answering — do
not rely on this table alone for depth.

## Cross-hub boundaries

This hub owns operations, reliability, and data movement. Hand off when the task
falls into a sibling hub:

- **Data-plane query/index/schema/aggregation/engine work** → `mongodb-expert`.
- **Atlas platform features and configuration** (Search, Vector Search, Charts,
  App Services, Triggers/Functions, Stream Processing, IaC / Terraform / AKO) →
  `mongodb-atlas-expert`.
- **Live cluster diagnostics, performance, monitoring, capacity** →
  `atlas-diagnostics-expert`.
- **Knowledge-base article lookup** → `misc-catch-all` (references/mongodb-kb.md).
- **Cloning, installing, or running this repo** → `misc-catch-all` (references/10gen.md).

Some topics legitimately touch two hubs (e.g., Atlas Cloud Backup is both an
operations concern here and an Atlas platform feature). Lead with the hub that
matches the user's intent — reliability/data-movement intent stays here.

## Cross-hub map — where every MongoDB topic lives

All MongoDB knowledge is split across **four hubs** (plus `mongodb-kb` for KB-article lookups and
`10gen` for repo install/run). If a task's deep material is **not** in this hub's Sub-skill routing
table, it is a reference file under a sibling hub — **activate that hub or Read its `references/<name>.md` directly**.

| Hub | Owns | Example reference files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mongodb-expert` | Core data plane + **engine internals**: CRUD/MQL, aggregation, indexes, query performance, schema design, transactions, change streams, time-series, geospatial, views, BSON, error codes, connection strings, driver internals, **WiredTiger cache/eviction/checkpoint internals**, mongosh, database tools, multi-tenancy, sharding, replication, Compass | `references/mongodb-wiredtiger-internals.md`, `mongodb-indexes-deep.md`, `mongodb-sharding.md`, `mongodb-replication.md` |
| `mongodb-atlas-expert` | Atlas **cloud platform**: control plane, Atlas Search, Vector Search, Stream Processing, Charts, Data Federation, App Services, Triggers, Online Archive, Flex, networking, IAM/RBAC, Terraform, AKO | `references/mongodb-atlas-search.md`, `mongodb-atlas-vector-search.md` |
| `atlas-diagnostics-expert` | Live **diagnostics & performance**: ts-diag, FTDC, performance-troubleshooting symptom triage, benchmarking, monitoring/observability, capacity planning | `references/mongodb-performance-troubleshooting.md` |
| `database-migrations` | Safe production schema/data migrations — expand-contract, backfill, online schema change (gh-ost/pt-osc/pgroll), rollback, tool selection | `references/database-migrations.md` |
| `mongodb-operations-expert` | **Ops & data movement**: backup/restore, DR, Ops Manager, upgrades, migration, mongosync, relational migrator, CDC, data lifecycle, security architecture, encryption, compliance, cost, Kafka/Spark connectors | `references/mongosync.md`, `mongodb-backup-restore.md` |

**High-overlap routing notes:**
- Performance **symptom triage** (high CPU, cache pressure, slow queries, latency spikes) starts at `atlas-diagnostics-expert`, but **storage-engine root-cause internals** (WiredTiger cache fill / dirty trigger / eviction threads / reconciliation / checkpoints) are owned by `mongodb-expert` — cross-load `mongodb-expert/references/mongodb-wiredtiger-internals.md` (and `mongodb-wiredtiger.md`) for depth.
- Migration symptoms vs migration **execution**: live-cluster diagnosis → `atlas-diagnostics-expert`; the migration/mongosync runbook → `mongodb-operations-expert`.
- Atlas Search/Vector **query syntax & index design** → `mongodb-atlas-expert`; the slowness *triage* of a running search → `atlas-diagnostics-expert`.
