# Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) & Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

> **Recency flag:** This field emerged in late 2023 and is still maturing rapidly as of mid-2026. Most "best practices" circulating online are based on small studies, vendor analyses, or extrapolation from classic SEO intuitions — not large-scale controlled experiments. The Princeton GEO paper is the strongest empirical anchor; treat other specific claims with proportional skepticism. Where the evidence base is thin, this skill says so explicitly.

---

## 1. Core Definitions and the GEO / AEO Distinction

### GEO — Generative Engine Optimization
Formally introduced by Aggarwal et al. (2023/2024, Princeton/NeurIPS/KDD) as optimizing content for visibility within **generative engine** responses — systems that synthesize multi-source answers using LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Codex). The academic definition is narrow: improve a source's "impression" (citation, quotation, word count contributed) in synthesized answers.

In practitioner usage GEO has broadened to mean: optimize your **entire digital presence** — own-site content, off-site mentions, entity signals, digital PR — so AI systems recognize your brand as a trusted authority. This wider framing treats AEO as a component of GEO.

### AEO — Answer Engine Optimization
Optimize content on your **own site** to be **extracted** and cited by AI-powered answer features: Google AI Overviews, featured snippets, Bing Copilot instant answers, Perplexity. AEO is more tractable (you control the page) but narrower in scope than full GEO.

### The relationship: overlapping, not synonymous
| Dimension | AEO | GEO |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Your own website content | Entire digital presence (on + off-site) |
| What you control | Almost everything | Partially — off-site requires third parties |
| Primary tactics | Answer-first structure, schema, headings | Entity establishment, digital PR, cross-platform presence, Knowledge Graph |
| Measurement | Citation rate on your own URLs | AI share of voice across a category |
| Practical entry point | Start here first | Build after AEO foundation |

Practitioner consensus (Loop, 2026; Pierview, 2026; UltraScout AI, 2026): **start with AEO (on-site), then build GEO (off-site authority)**. The terms are often used interchangeably by vendors; choose whichever framing fits the conversation.

### The shift from rankings to citations
Classic SEO optimizes for *position* in a ranked list. GEO/AEO optimizes for *citation* — being surfaced and attributed inside a synthesized paragraph the user never clicks away from. Zero-click is the structural outcome: Google AI Overviews appear for an estimated 30–40% of informational and commercial queries in 2026 (Presenc AI, 2026), and the user may not visit any cited source.

## 2. How Each Engine Selects and Cites Sources

### Decision table: surface-by-surface mechanics

| Engine | Retrieval model | Cites by default? | Key differentiators |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google AI Overviews / AI Mode** | Multi-stage pipeline: semantic retrieval → E-E-A-T gate → Gemini passage re-rank → data fusion | Yes, 5–15 sources avg | E-E-A-T is binary pass/fail gate at Stage 3; passage-level extractability decisive |
| **Perplexity** | RAG: real-time web search on every query, no knowledge cutoff | Always — every response | 5 sources/claim; favors original data, named methodology, H2/H3 Q-structure; 46.7% citations from Reddit in some categories |
| **ChatGPT (search/browse mode)** | Hybrid: trained model first, web search when needed; OAI-SearchBot gates eligibility | Only in search/browse mode | Highest citation count (10.42 links/response in one study); ~0% overlap with Google top-10; strong domain-age and editorial-trust signals |
| **Bing Copilot** | High-quality web results synthesis; step-by-step and comparison content favored | Yes | Fewest citations (3.13 avg); lowest domain overlap with other engines (9.81% with Google AIO) |
| **Gemini (search-grounded)** | Google infrastructure + Knowledge Graph grounding | Yes | Schema markup, entity disambiguation, cross-domain consistency amplified by KG presence |

**Cross-platform finding:** Only 11% of domains cited by ChatGPT for a given prompt are also cited by Perplexity (Indexly, 2026). Optimizing for one engine does not automatically carry over.

### Google AI Overviews: the pipeline in detail
Google's own documentation (Google, 2024) confirms a **query fan-out** step: the system expands the original query into related sub-queries, retrieves candidates per subtopic, scores for quality and coverage, deduplicates, and formats source cards. Key research findings (ZipTie.dev, 2026; Presenc AI, 2026):

- Only 38% of AIO-cited pages now rank in organic top 10 (down from 76% a year prior) — traditional SEO rank is necessary but no longer sufficient.
- E-E-A-T filtering is a **binary gate** at Stage 3: 96% of citations come from sources that clear it; content below threshold is excluded before passage evaluation.
- Passage-level extractability is decisive: self-contained answer units of 134–167 words at Stage 4 re-ranking.
- Entity density: 15+ Knowledge Graph entities per 1,000 words correlates with higher selection.
- Cited pages average 2,100 words vs. 1,400 for non-cited pages at the same rank (Presenc AI, 2026).
- 72% of cited pages have schema.org markup vs. 41% of non-cited peers (Presenc AI, 2026).

## 3. Tactics with Evidence

### 3.1 The Princeton GEO paper — what was actually tested (arXiv:2311.09735)
Aggarwal et al. tested nine discrete optimization methods on GEO-bench (10,000 diverse queries). Results by measured lift in Position-Adjusted Word Count:

| GEO Method | Relative lift | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Cite Sources** (add in-content citations to credible sources) | 30–40% | Highest — top performer |
| **Quotation Addition** (incorporate credible expert quotes) | 30–40% | Highest — top performer |
| **Statistics Addition** (add quantitative data, replace qualitative discussion) | 30–40% | Highest — top performer |
| Authoritative style (persuasive, authoritative claims) | Moderate | Moderate |
| Easy-to-Understand (simplify language) | Moderate | Moderate |
| Fluency Optimization | Moderate | Moderate |
| Technical Terms | Domain-dependent | Variable |
| Unique Words | Domain-dependent | Variable |
| Keyword Stuffing | Weakest / negative in some domains | Low |

**Key caveat:** GEO-bench uses Perplexity as its real-world generative engine test case. Results on other engines (especially ChatGPT's training-data-influenced model mode) may differ substantially. The paper also acknowledges the black-box, fast-moving nature of GEs means these levers are not guaranteed to be stable.

### 3.2 Passage-level answerability
Structure content so that individual paragraphs or sections can be extracted verbatim as a complete answer to a specific question. Recommended pattern (multiple sources, 2025-2026):
- H2/H3 headings that mirror how users phrase the query ("How does X work?", "What is Y?")
- Answer the heading question in the **first sentence or two** of that section (inverted pyramid per section)
- Self-contained units of ~134–167 words (ZipTie.dev passage-extraction research)
- Avoid burying the answer behind long preambles

### 3.3 Question-led structure and FAQ architecture
- FAQ schema (FAQPage, HowTo, Article from schema.org) correlates with 40% higher citation weighting in ChatGPT and significant increases in Google AIO citation rates (Leapd AI, 2026)
- FAQ sections function as pre-extracted passages — each Q+A is a retrievable unit
- Question-format H2/H3 subheadings that mirror user phrasing directly improve semantic retrieval at Stage 1 of the AIO pipeline

### 3.4 Schema.org / structured data
- 72% of AIO-cited pages have schema.org markup vs. 41% of non-cited peers at same rank (Presenc AI, 2026)
- High-value schema types for citation: `Article`, `FAQPage`, `HowTo`, `BreadcrumbList`, `Person` (author expertise)
- Schema signals are read at Stage 3 (E-E-A-T verification) in Google's pipeline; they are a trust signal, not a ranking factor directly

### 3.5 E-E-A-T signals
Google's E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) functions as a **binary pass/fail gate**, not a gradient, in AIO pipeline research (ZipTie.dev, 2026). Concrete signals that raise E-E-A-T:
- Named author bylines with verifiable credentials and links to author profiles
- Explicit publication and last-updated dates
- External citations to authoritative primary sources within the content
- About/team pages establishing organizational expertise
- Consistent HTTPS, canonical URLs, clean link graph
- Pages with author byline + expertise signals: 54% citation rate vs. 29% for pages without (Presenc AI, 2026)

### 3.6 Entity and topical authority
AI systems, particularly Gemini (Google KG-grounded), evaluate **entity recognition** as part of source selection:
- Establish your brand/person as a named entity in Google's Knowledge Graph (Wikipedia, Wikidata presence; consistent NAP/entity data across the web; structured data `Organization`/`Person` markup)
- "Entity chain" strategy (MachineRelations AI, 2026): build a distributed set of independently verifiable cross-domain mentions, citations, and structured data that multiple retrieval systems can all resolve
- Brands are **6.5x more likely to be cited via external (third-party) mentions** than from their own domain alone (Brand24/Semrush data, 2025)

### 3.7 Freshness
- 53% of content cited in AI search had been updated within the last six months (Leapd AI, 2026)
- Pages updated within 12 months are **2x more likely** to earn citations than older stale pages
- Perplexity has **no knowledge cutoff** — new content can be cited within hours of indexing; ChatGPT search mode similarly uses OAI-SearchBot for real-time fetching
- Practical implication: maintain a "freshness audit" cadence for key pages targeting AI citation

### 3.8 llms.txt — proposal status, not a standard
Jeremy Howard (fast.ai) proposed `/llms.txt` in September 2024: a curated markdown file at a website root summarizing content for LLMs, analogous to robots.txt. Assessment as of mid-2026:

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Major LLMs read llms.txt | **No** — Ahrefs (July 2025): "no major LLM provider currently supports llms.txt. Not OpenAI. Not Anthropic. Not Google." |
| Adoption rate | ~10% of domains in one 300K-domain study (SE Ranking, Nov 2025) |
| GPTBot behavior | Sometimes fetches llms.txt, but infrequently and without documented downstream effect |
| Recommendation | Low-cost to add; zero evidence of citation benefit today; may matter if adoption grows |

**Do not overstate llms.txt.** It is an emerging community proposal with an elegant idea but no confirmed uptake from major AI providers as of the research date. Vendors promoting it as a citation lever are getting ahead of the evidence.

## 4. Measurement: AI Citation Tracking

### The analytics gap
Google Analytics classifies AI crawler traffic as "Direct" — there is currently **no native way** in GA4 or Google Search Console to measure how much traffic originates from AI-generated citations. This is the central measurement challenge for GEO/AEO practitioners.

### Metrics and tools

| Metric | Definition | Tools (2026) |
|---|---|---|
| **Citation Rate** | % of AI responses to brand-relevant prompts that include a citation to your domain | Citelytic, Indexly, Citability, Brand24 AI Visibility |
| **AI Share of Voice** | Your citations as a % of all citations in a category across competing domains | All the above + Semrush AI Toolkit, Profound, Otterly.ai |
| **Citation Rank** | Your domain's position among ~300+ cited sources for a category | Indexly |
| **Health Score** | Composite score: citation rate + share of voice + sentiment | Citelytic |

### Caveats on measurement
- Tool coverage varies by engine; most tools query ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Codex — Bing Copilot less consistently
- Citation tracking requires **predefined prompt lists** — results are only as representative as the prompts you design
- Only 11% of ChatGPT-cited domains overlap with Perplexity-cited domains for the same prompt — per-engine measurement is necessary
- No tool currently provides statistically reliable causal attribution between a content change and a citation lift

## 5. Quick-Reference Decision Table: Which Tactic for Which Surface

| Tactic | Google AIO | Perplexity | ChatGPT Search | Gemini |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add in-content citations to credible sources | High impact | High impact | High impact | High impact |
| Add named statistics (original data preferred) | High | High | Medium | High |
| Expert quotations | High | High | Medium | Medium |
| FAQPage + HowTo schema | High | Medium | Medium | High |
| Named author byline + credentials | High (E-E-A-T gate) | Medium | Medium | High (KG grounding) |
| Publication + last-updated dates | High | High | Medium | High |
| H2/H3 question-format headings | High | High | Medium | Medium |
| Self-contained 134–167w answer passages | High | High | Medium | Medium |
| Knowledge Graph entity establishment | Medium | Low | Low | High |
| Third-party off-site mentions / digital PR | Medium | High | Medium | Medium |
| llms.txt | None (no evidence) | None | None | None |

## 6. The "Zero-Click" Reality

GEO/AEO success means AI surfaces your content — but may not send traffic. The economic tension:
- AI referral traffic that does arrive converts at approximately **4.4x the value of traditional organic traffic** (Semrush/Brand24, 2025) — smaller volume, higher intent
- But zero-click reduces total referral traffic; brand visibility in the answer may be the primary value, not the click
- Perplexity always cites; Google AIO links are present but users often don't click; ChatGPT search mode cites only when in search mode

There is **no evidence-based answer** to "does appearing in AI Overviews increase or decrease total site traffic" that holds across industries and query types. Treat any vendor claim to the contrary skeptically.

---

## 7. Honest Caveats and Epistemic Status

1. **Black-box systems:** Google, OpenAI, and Perplexity do not publish their citation-selection algorithms. All "signals" research is correlational, not causal.
2. **Fast-moving target:** The Princeton paper used Perplexity as its test engine in 2023; Google AIO launched in May 2024; ChatGPT search launched late 2024. Findings from 12 months ago may already be stale.
3. **Vendor hype is heavy:** Dozens of GEO/AEO SaaS tools launched in 2024-2026. Their case studies and percentage-lift claims are marketing materials, not peer-reviewed research.
4. **Domain-specificity:** The GEO paper explicitly found that the efficacy of methods varies across domains; there is no universal playbook.
5. **The E-E-A-T gate finding** (96% of AIO citations clear E-E-A-T) is from a third-party analysis (Wellows/ZipTie.dev), not Google documentation.
6. **llms.txt has no confirmed citation benefit** as of the research date (mid-2026).
