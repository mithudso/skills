# Estate Planning & Wills (North Carolina focus)

> **Educational legal information only; NOT legal advice.** Estate law is **state-specific and fact-specific**, and NC statutes change. Everything here is **as of 2026** and describes **North Carolina** law for an individual; another state's rules differ. Statute citations are to the **NC General Statutes (G.S.)**; verify the current text at [ncleg.gov](https://www.ncleg.gov) and the process at the [NC Judicial Branch](https://www.nccourts.gov). For your own plan, a contested estate, a blended family, sizable or out-of-state assets, a special-needs beneficiary, or any tax question, **consult a NC-licensed estate-planning attorney.** This skill is a spoke of the **consumer-finance** family; the **`consumer-finance`** hub is the anchor, and the sibling **`consumer-credit-and-debt`** hub owns credit/debt — so route debts-after-death and NC creditor questions to its **`north-carolina-credit-and-debt-law`** spoke.

This skill is **knowledge**: explain the core documents, how NC intestacy and probate work, and where to verify. It is not a form-filling or legal-drafting engine; point people to a licensed attorney or the official AOC forms.

## Routing detail

Use this skill for the **core estate-planning documents and NC probate**. The description's `SKIP:` clause is abbreviated for length; the full deferral set is here. Each carve-out names the seam precisely, because the topics share vocabulary:

| When the question is really about | Route to |
| --- | --- |
| Who actually **owes a decedent's debts**, whether you inherit debt, NC garnishment / statute of limitations / foreclosure (this skill covers only the executor's creditor-claim *process*) | `north-carolina-credit-and-debt-law` |
| **Income tax** owed on inherited money, whether an inheritance is taxable income, tax brackets, filing (this skill covers only estate & inheritance *transfer* tax) | `personal-income-taxes` |
| **Retirement-account contribution strategy** (Roth vs traditional, limits, backdoor Roth) | `investing-and-retirement` |
| **Life insurance as a product** (term vs whole, how much to buy, how to shop) (this skill covers only *why a beneficiary designation overrides the will*) | `personal-insurance` |
| **POD/TOD or joint-account setup mechanics** and FDIC/NCUA coverage (this skill covers only the *will-override effect*) | `personal-banking` |
| **Consumer bankruptcy** (Ch. 7 / 13) | `bankruptcy-ch7-ch13` |
| **Forming, converting, or succeeding a business entity** | `venture-nc-business-formation-tax` / `venture-nc-entity-lifecycle` |

---

## The core documents (almost everyone needs these four)

A complete basic NC estate plan is usually **four documents**, not just a will:

1. **Last Will and Testament.** Directs who gets your property, names your **executor** (personal representative), and (critically) **names a guardian for minor children**. Takes effect only at death and only after it is **probated**. Does *not* avoid probate and does *not* control beneficiary-designation or jointly-titled assets (see below).
2. **Durable (Financial) Power of Attorney.** Lets an **agent** manage your money/property **while you are alive but incapacitated**. NC = the **Uniform Power of Attorney Act, G.S. Chapter 32C**. Dies with you (then the will/executor takes over).
3. **Health-Care Power of Attorney.** Names an agent to make **medical** decisions if you cannot. NC statutory form: **G.S. 32A-25.1** (Chapter 32A, Article 3).
4. **Living Will / Advance Directive ("Declaration of a Desire for a Natural Death").** Your wishes about life-prolonging measures at end of life. NC = **Right to a Natural Death, G.S. 90-321** (Chapter 90, Article 23). Often paired with a **HIPAA authorization** so providers may share records with the people you name.

Supporting pieces: up-to-date **beneficiary designations** (retirement/life insurance), correct **account titling** (joint, POD/TOD), and a **digital-assets** plan (below).

---

## Wills in North Carolina

**Who may make one (G.S. 31-1):** any person **18 or older** and of **sound mind**.

**Attested written will, the standard will (G.S. 31-3.3):** a written will **signed by the testator** and **attested by at least two competent witnesses**, who sign **in the testator's presence** (they need not sign in each other's presence). Best practice: a witness should be **disinterested** (not a beneficiary).

**Self-proving affidavit (G.S. 31-11.6):** a notarized affidavit by the testator and witnesses, executed with the will (or later). It lets the will be **probated without locating the witnesses** after death, a major convenience. **Strongly recommended.**

**Holographic will (G.S. 31-3.4):** a will **entirely in the testator's own handwriting**, with the testator's signature (or name written by the testator), found among valuable papers/effects after death. **No witnesses required**, but it is harder to probate (extra proof under G.S. 28A-2A-9) and easy to get wrong; a properly witnessed, self-proved attested will is far safer.

**What a will does / does NOT do:**
- **Does:** distribute *probate* assets, name the **executor**, name a **guardian** for minor children, can create a **testamentary trust**.
- **Does NOT:** control assets that pass by **beneficiary designation, POD/TOD, or survivorship titling**; avoid probate; take effect before death; or transfer anything until it is **probated** before the Clerk of Superior Court.

**The executor (personal representative):** the person you name to gather assets, give creditor notice, pay valid debts and taxes, and distribute what remains, all under the Clerk's supervision (NC estate administration = **G.S. Chapter 28A**). Name a backup. If there is no will, the court appoints an **administrator**.

**You cannot fully disinherit a spouse (the elective share, G.S. 30-3.1):** even a valid will leaving a spouse little or nothing can be overridden. A surviving spouse may instead claim an **elective share** of the decedent's **Total Net Assets**, on a sliding scale by length of marriage: **15%** (married < 5 years), **25%** (5 to < 10), **33%** (10 to < 15), **50%** (15+ years), reduced by what already passes to the spouse (calculation under G.S. 30-3.4). The claim is filed with the Clerk **within 6 months** of letters being issued. (You generally *can* disinherit an adult child; NC does not protect children the way it protects a spouse.)

---

## If you die with no will — NC Intestate Succession Act (G.S. Chapter 29)

"Intestate" = no valid will. State law (not your wishes) then dictates who inherits. NC shares (**G.S. 29-14**, **G.S. 29-15**; figures **as of 2026, verify**):

**Surviving spouse's share** depends on who else survives:

| Who else survives | Spouse's real property | Spouse's personal property |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No children, no parents** | All | All |
| **One child** (or that child's line) | 1/2 | First **$60,000** + 1/2 of the rest |
| **Two or more children** (or their lines) | 1/3 | First **$60,000** + 1/3 of the rest |
| **No children, but a parent survives** | 1/2 | First **$100,000** + 1/2 of the rest |

Whatever the spouse does **not** take passes to children/descendants (per G.S. 29-15/29-16). **No spouse and no descendants** → up the family tree to parents, then siblings, then more remote kin. **Unmarried partners, stepchildren, and friends inherit nothing under intestacy**; only a will (or beneficiary designations/trust) can provide for them. This is the single best reason to have a will.

---

## Beneficiary designations & non-probate transfers — these OVERRIDE the will

A huge share of wealth passes **outside** the will and is **not** controlled by it:

- **Retirement accounts** (401(k), IRA), **life insurance**, and annuities pass to the **named beneficiary** on the account, regardless of what the will says.
- **Payable-on-Death (POD)** bank accounts and **Transfer-on-Death (TOD)** brokerage accounts pass to the named person.
- **Joint accounts / property with right of survivorship** pass to the surviving owner.

**Consequences:** a stale designation (an ex-spouse, a predeceased parent) controls over your current will. **Review beneficiary forms after every major life event** (marriage, divorce, birth, death). Naming a **minor** directly, or your **estate**, can backfire, so ask an attorney about a trust or custodial arrangement. These assets also **skip probate**, which is part of why they matter.

---

## Trusts — revocable living trust vs a will

A **revocable living trust** is created during life; you move assets into it and typically serve as your own trustee, naming a **successor trustee** to take over at incapacity or death. Assets **titled in the trust avoid probate** and pass privately per the trust terms.

**Trust vs will — the trade-off:**
- **A will** is simpler and cheaper to create, but its probate assets go through the **public** probate process.
- **A revocable trust** can **avoid probate**, ease management at **incapacity**, keep terms **private**, and help with **out-of-state real estate**, but only for assets you actually **retitle into it** (an unfunded trust does nothing); it also costs more up front and does **not** reduce income or estate tax by itself.

**Is it worth it in NC?** NC probate is relatively **clerk-driven and moderate-cost**, and small/spousal estates have streamlined paths (below), so a trust is **not automatic** for everyone. It tends to pay off with real estate in multiple states, a desire for privacy, planning for incapacity, or more complex family situations. Even with a trust you still need a **"pour-over" will**, a financial POA, and health-care documents. Decide with a NC attorney.

---

## Power of attorney (financial) — NC Uniform POA Act, G.S. Chapter 32C

A **power of attorney** lets your **agent** act on your behalf for **property and financial** matters. In NC:
- **"Durable"** is the default: under the modern Act a POA is durable (it **survives your incapacity**) **unless** it expressly says otherwise (**G.S. 32C-1-104**). Durability is the whole point; a non-durable POA ends exactly when you'd need it most.
- **Execution (G.S. 32C-1-105):** sign before a **notary** (acknowledged). To bind real estate, **record** it with the county Register of Deeds.
- **Statutory short form:** NC provides a fill-in form at **G.S. 32C-3-301**.
- A POA **ends at death**; after that the **will/executor** governs. Choose an agent you trust completely; the agent owes you **fiduciary duties**. (For elder financial-exploitation concerns, CFPB has consumer guidance; see References.)

---

## Health-care decisions — Health-Care POA & Living Will (NC Chapter 32A / Chapter 90)

Two complementary documents:
- **Health-Care Power of Attorney (G.S. 32A-25.1 statutory form):** names a **health-care agent** to make medical decisions when you **cannot speak for yourself**; broader and more flexible than a living will because a person adapts to circumstances.
- **Living Will / "Declaration of a Desire for a Natural Death" (G.S. 90-321):** states whether you want **life-prolonging measures** withheld/withdrawn in specified end-of-life conditions. NC's form may be **combined with** the health-care POA. Both require **signing, qualified witnesses, and notarization** under their statutes.
- Add a **HIPAA authorization** so providers can release records to your agent/family. Give copies to your agent, doctor, and hospital; NC also has an **Advance Health Care Directive Registry** (NC Secretary of State).

---

## NC probate — the process at the Clerk of Superior Court

In NC the **elected Clerk of Superior Court** in each county acts as the **probate judge**; estate administration is governed by **G.S. Chapter 28A**. A will **has no legal effect until probated**.

**Full administration (rough arc):**
1. The person named executor applies to the Clerk (forms in the **AOC-E** series, e.g., **AOC-E-201**) and qualifies; the Clerk issues **Letters** (Testamentary, or of Administration if no will).
2. The personal representative **inventories** assets, **gives notice to creditors**, **pays valid debts and taxes**, then **distributes** the remainder and files a **final account**.

**Creditor claims (G.S. 28A-19-3, G.S. 28A-14-1):** the personal representative publishes/mails notice giving creditors a deadline **at least three months out**; most claims **not presented by the deadline (or within 90 days of a mailed notice, if later) are forever barred**. This is why probate takes months.

**Streamlined paths (figures as of 2026, verify):**
- **Small-estate collection by affidavit (G.S. 28A-25-1):** if the decedent's **personal property** (net of liens) is **≤ $20,000** (or **≤ $30,000 where the sole heir is the surviving spouse**), an heir/creditor can collect by **affidavit 30 days after death**, skipping full administration.
- **Summary administration (G.S. 28A-28):** when the **surviving spouse is the sole beneficiary/heir**, the spouse can petition to take the estate while assuming the decedent's debts.
- **Year's Allowance (G.S. 30-15):** a surviving spouse is entitled to a **$60,000** support allowance (and an allowance may be claimed for each dependent child), paid ahead of most claims and **exempt from the decedent's creditors**.

**No NC estate or inheritance tax** (below), but the estate may still owe the decedent's final **income taxes**.

---

## Guardianship for minor children

If both parents die while a child is a minor, the **court appoints a guardian**. Your **will is where you nominate** the guardian of the **person** (who raises the child) and can address the guardian of the **estate** (who manages the child's money); NC guardianship sits in **G.S. Chapter 35A**. The court isn't strictly bound but gives your nomination great weight. Pair it with a way to **hold the child's money** (a testamentary trust or UTMA custodianship via **G.S. Chapter 33A**) so a young adult doesn't receive a lump sum outright. Naming a guardian is often the most important reason a young parent makes a will.

---

## Digital assets after death — NC RUFADAA (G.S. Chapter 36F)

NC has adopted the **Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (G.S. Chapter 36F)**, which governs whether your **fiduciary** (executor, agent, trustee, guardian) can access email, photos, cloud files, and online accounts. **Order of control:** a provider's **online tool** (e.g., a "legacy contact" / inactive-account manager) **wins first**; absent that, your **will/trust/POA** directions control; absent both, the provider's terms of service apply. **Action:** set legacy-contact tools where offered, and have your will/POA **expressly grant** digital-asset authority. Keep credentials in a secure manager, not listed in the will itself (the will becomes a public record once probated).

---

## Taxes — most NC estates owe nothing

- **North Carolina has NO estate tax and NO inheritance tax** (both repealed effective **Jan 1, 2013**). NC heirs do **not** pay a state death tax. *(Inherited assets can still generate later income, e.g. distributions from an inherited IRA, which is income-tax, not death-tax; see `personal-income-taxes` and `investing-and-retirement`.)*
- **Federal estate tax** applies only to very large estates. **As of 2026** the exemption is **$15 million per person** (~$30 million per married couple), **made permanent by the 2025 law (OBBBA)**, indexed for inflation, with a top **40%** rate on the excess; estates over the threshold file **IRS Form 706**. **The vast majority of estates owe no federal estate tax.** Spouses also get **portability** of an unused exemption and an unlimited **marital deduction**. **Figures change; verify at irs.gov.**

---

## DIY vs lawyer

- **Reasonable DIY candidates:** a young, healthy person with simple assets and a clear plan: a statutory health-care POA, a financial POA, and a straightforward witnessed-and-self-proved will. NC's statutory forms exist precisely for this. Even then, get **execution right** (signature + two witnesses + notarized self-proving affidavit), or the will can fail.
- **See a NC-licensed attorney when:** you have a **blended family**, **minor or special-needs** beneficiaries, **business interests**, **out-of-state real estate**, a sizable estate, **any trust**, you want to **avoid probate**, you're **disinheriting** someone (remember the spousal **elective share**, G.S. 30-3.1, above), or there's potential **conflict**. The cost of a small mistake (an invalid will, a stale beneficiary, an unfunded trust) usually dwarfs the cost of advice.
