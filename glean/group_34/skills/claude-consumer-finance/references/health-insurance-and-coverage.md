# Health insurance & coverage (US consumer)

> **Framing — read first.** This is **general educational information, NOT
> insurance, medical, tax, or financial advice.** US health-coverage rules —
> especially **subsidy amounts and enrollment dates — change every year and are
> unusually volatile right now (2026).** Every figure here is stamped **"as of
> 2026"** and should be re-verified before you rely on it. Authoritative checks:
> **[healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov)** (marketplace),
> **[medicare.gov](https://www.medicare.gov)** (Medicare),
> your **state Medicaid agency**, and **[irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov)** (HSA limits).

This skill is a **spoke of the `consumer-finance` hub** (the personal-finance
router). Its **sibling hub, `consumer-credit-and-debt`,** owns the
credit/debt/collections side — route there when a medical or other bill becomes
a collections or credit-reporting matter. Sibling spokes referenced below:
**`personal-income-taxes`** (HSA tax-form mechanics), **`medical-debt-and-billing`**
(the bills after care), and **`personal-insurance`** (auto/home/life/disability).

## Part 1 — How a health plan works (the mechanics)

You almost never pay the "sticker" price of care. A plan splits cost between you
and the insurer through a few interlocking levers. Learn these six and you can
read any plan.

### The cost-sharing ladder

- **Premium** — the fixed monthly amount you pay to *have* the plan, whether or
  not you use it. A premium is not a cap on anything; it buys the contract.
- **Deductible** — what you pay **out of pocket first**, each plan year, before
  the insurer starts paying its share for most services. A $2,000 deductible
  means you cover the first $2,000 of covered care. (Some services — often
  preventive care, sometimes a few copay'd visits — are covered *before* the
  deductible.)
- **Copay (copayment)** — a **fixed dollar** amount for a specific service
  (e.g., $30 for a primary-care visit, $15 for a generic drug). Predictable.
- **Coinsurance** — your **percentage share** of a covered service *after* the
  deductible (e.g., you pay 20%, the plan pays 80% of the allowed amount).
- **Out-of-pocket maximum (OOP max)** — **the single most important number for
  worst-case protection.** It is the most you can pay in a plan year for covered,
  in-network services (deductible + copays + coinsurance all count toward it;
  **premiums do not**). Once you hit it, the plan pays **100%** of covered
  in-network care for the rest of the year. A low premium with a high OOP max is
  a bet you won't get sick; the OOP max is what bankrupts people who lose that bet.

> **Mental model:** premium = the cost of *having* coverage; deductible/copay/
> coinsurance = the cost of *using* it; OOP max = the ceiling on how bad a year
> can get. A "cheap" plan usually just moves money from the premium into the
> deductible and OOP max.

### Networks & plan types

Plans contract with a **network** of doctors/hospitals at negotiated rates.
Going **out of network** can mean paying full freight or having it not count
toward your OOP max. The four common structures (as of 2026):

| Type | Out-of-network covered? | Referral to see a specialist? | Trade-off |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| **HMO** (Health Maintenance Org) | No (emergencies only) | Yes (via a PCP) | Cheapest, least flexible |
| **EPO** (Exclusive Provider Org) | No (emergencies only) | Usually no | Cheaper, no referrals, network-locked |
| **POS** (Point of Service) | Yes, at higher cost | Yes (via a PCP) | Hybrid |
| **PPO** (Preferred Provider Org) | Yes, at higher cost | No | Most flexible, usually priciest |

Always confirm your doctors and hospitals are **in network for the specific
plan** — networks differ even between plans from the same insurer.

### Drugs, approvals, and paperwork

- **Formulary** — the plan's list of covered drugs, sorted into **tiers**
  (generic → preferred brand → non-preferred → specialty), each with its own
  cost share. A drug off-formulary may not be covered at all.
- **Prior authorization (PA)** — the insurer must approve certain drugs,
  procedures, or imaging **before** you get them, or they won't pay. Build in
  time; a denied PA is appealable (see Part 5).
- **EOB (Explanation of Benefits)** — **not a bill.** It's the statement the
  insurer sends after a claim showing what was billed, what the plan allowed,
  what it paid, and what you may owe. Compare the EOB to the provider's actual
  bill before paying — mismatches and the bills themselves are a
  **`medical-debt-and-billing`** topic.

---

## Part 2 — Where coverage comes from (decision guide)

Most people get coverage from **one** of these sources. Work top-down; the first
match is usually your best/cheapest option.

1. **Employer-sponsored insurance (ESI / group plan)** — offered by your or a
   family member's employer; the employer typically pays a large share of the
   premium, and your contribution is usually pre-tax. **Usually the best deal if
   offered**, because of the employer subsidy. Enrollment is at hire, during the
   employer's annual open enrollment, or after a **qualifying life event**.
   *Caveat:* if the employer's offer is "affordable" by IRS rules, it generally
   **disqualifies you from marketplace premium tax credits.**

2. **Medicare** — if you're 65+ or qualify by disability/ESRD/ALS → **Part 3.**

3. **Medicaid / CHIP** — if your income is low → **Part 4.**

4. **ACA Marketplace (healthcare.gov or your state exchange)** — the default for
   the self-employed, those without an employer offer, early retirees, etc.
   Details below.

5. **COBRA** — a *bridge*, not a destination, when you lose an employer plan
   (see end of this Part).

### The ACA Marketplace (as of 2026)

- **Metal tiers** set how the plan splits cost (all cover the same essential
  benefits): **Bronze** (low premium, high OOP — pairs with an HSA if HSA-eligible),
  **Silver** (moderate; **the only tier that unlocks cost-sharing reductions**),
  **Gold** (higher premium, lower OOP), **Platinum** (highest premium, lowest OOP).
  Pick by *expected use*, not premium alone: heavy/predictable care → Gold/Platinum;
  healthy + savings cushion → Bronze; **anyone who qualifies for CSRs → Silver.**

- **Premium tax credit (PTC) / APTC** — a subsidy that lowers your monthly
  premium, based on household size and **estimated annual income.** Taken in
  advance it's the **APTC** (Advance Premium Tax Credit); you **reconcile** it on
  your tax return (**Form 8962**) against actual income — underestimate income and
  you may **repay** part of it. (The income-estimate and reconciliation mechanics
  cross-ref **`personal-income-taxes`**.)

- **Cost-sharing reductions (CSRs / "extra savings")** — a *separate* discount
  (on top of the PTC) that lowers your **deductible, copays, and coinsurance** for
  lower-income enrollees — **but only if you enroll in a Silver plan.** If you
  qualify for CSRs, a Silver plan is usually the right answer even when Bronze is
  cheaper monthly.

- **🚩 2026 POLICY VOLATILITY — verify before relying.** The **enhanced premium
  tax credits** (the temporarily larger ARPA/IRA subsidies that, among other
  things, removed the old "subsidy cliff" and capped premiums as a % of income
  above 400% FPL) **expired December 31, 2025.** As of 2026, the law reverts to
  the **pre-2021 structure**: PTCs generally only for **100–400% of the federal
  poverty level (FPL)**, and the **400% FPL "subsidy cliff" returns** — a dollar
  of income over the line can cost thousands in lost subsidy, hitting **older,
  middle-income** enrollees hardest. Whether Congress extends/changes this is
  unsettled — **check current rules at healthcare.gov before assuming subsidy
  amounts or the cliff's status.**

- **Open Enrollment (OEP)** — the annual window to enroll/switch. For plan-year
  2026 on healthcare.gov it ran **~Nov 1, 2025 – Jan 15, 2026** (enroll by ~Dec 15
  for a Jan 1 start; state exchanges vary). Dates shift year to year — confirm.

- **Special Enrollment Period (SEP)** — a window *outside* OEP triggered by a
  **qualifying life event**: losing other coverage (incl. job loss, aging off a
  parent's plan at 26), moving, marriage, birth/adoption, etc. SEPs are usually
  ~60 days from the event. Losing CSRs can itself trigger an SEP. **Not every life
  change qualifies** — e.g., a raise that pushes you over a subsidy threshold, or
  voluntarily dropping coverage, generally does **not** open a marketplace SEP; if
  no SEP applies you wait for the next OEP. Confirm your event qualifies at
  healthcare.gov.

### COBRA (the bridge)

When you lose an employer plan (job loss, hours cut, divorce, etc.), **COBRA**
lets you keep the *same* plan temporarily — but you now pay the **full premium +
up to a 2% admin fee** (i.e., the part the employer used to cover too), so it's
often expensive. Key facts (as of 2026): you generally get **60 days** to elect
after coverage ends or the election notice (whichever is later); standard
duration is **up to 18 months** (extendable to 29 with an SSA disability
determination, or 36 for certain dependent events). **Compare COBRA against a
marketplace plan** — job loss is an SEP, and a subsidized marketplace plan is
frequently cheaper than unsubsidized COBRA.

---

## Part 3 — HDHP + HSA (and how it's taxed)

A **High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)** is a plan whose deductible/OOP limits
meet IRS thresholds; pairing it with a **Health Savings Account (HSA)** is the
only way to get an HSA. **You must be enrolled in a qualifying HDHP and have no
disqualifying other coverage to contribute** — a **general-purpose FSA**
(yours *or* a spouse's) and enrollment in **Medicare** both block HSA
contributions; a limited-purpose (dental/vision) FSA does not.

**The HSA "triple tax advantage":** (1) contributions are **pre-tax /
deductible**, (2) growth is **tax-free**, (3) withdrawals for **qualified medical
expenses are tax-free.** The HSA is **yours and portable** (unlike most FSAs),
**rolls over** year to year, and after age 65 acts like an IRA for non-medical
withdrawals (taxed as income, no penalty).

**IRS limits & thresholds (tax year 2026 — verify at irs.gov):**

| 2026 | Self-only | Family |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **HSA contribution limit** | **$4,400** | **$8,750** |
| HSA catch-up (age 55+) | +$1,000 | +$1,000 *(per spouse — see note)* |
| HDHP **minimum** deductible | $2,900 | $5,850 |
| HDHP **maximum** OOP (to qualify as an HDHP) | $8,500 | $17,000 |

> **Catch-up is per eligible individual, not per family.** Each spouse 55+ gets
> their own $1,000 catch-up, but it must go into **that spouse's own HSA** — a
> couple can't pool both catch-ups in one account. So a family where both spouses
> are 55+ can contribute $8,750 + $1,000 + $1,000, but only by **each opening an HSA.**

> **HSA vs FSA (quick contrast):** an **FSA** is employer-owned, generally
> **"use it or lose it"** (limited carryover), **not portable**, and doesn't
> require an HDHP; an **HSA** is **portable, rolls over, invests, and requires an
> HDHP.** A **limited-purpose FSA** (dental/vision) can coexist with an HSA.

> **Cross-ref:** the **HSA tax mechanics** — reporting contributions/distributions
> on **Form 8889**, the above-the-line deduction, and reconciliation — live in
> **`personal-income-taxes`**, not here. This skill covers the *coverage* side
> (eligibility, the HDHP pairing, the limits).

## Part 4 — Medicaid (incl. NC expansion)

**Medicaid** is joint federal-state coverage for low-income people; **eligibility,
names, and benefits vary by state.** Under the ACA, states can **expand** Medicaid
to nearly all adults under **138% of the federal poverty level (FPL)**; some
states have not. **CHIP** covers children in families earning a bit too much for
Medicaid. Medicaid enrollment is **year-round** (no open-enrollment window).

**🟢 North Carolina expanded Medicaid — live since December 1, 2023.** NC now
covers adults **ages 19–64 up to ~138% FPL** (roughly **$1,800/month for a single
person**, **~$3,000–$3,065/month for a family of three** — figures change
annually). This closed NC's old "coverage gap." Verify eligibility and current
income limits at **[medicaid.ncdhhs.gov](https://medicaid.ncdhhs.gov)**.

If a healthcare.gov application finds you (or your kids) likely Medicaid/CHIP-
eligible, it routes you to the state agency — you generally can't take a
marketplace subsidy instead.

---

## Part 5 — Medicare basics

**Medicare** is federal coverage for people **65+** (and certain people under 65
with disability, ESRD, or ALS). Two ways to assemble it:

**The parts:**
- **Part A — Hospital insurance.** Inpatient hospital, skilled nursing, hospice.
  **Usually premium-free** if you/spouse paid Medicare taxes ~10 years.
- **Part B — Medical insurance.** Doctors, outpatient, preventive, durable
  equipment. **Has a monthly premium** (standard **$202.90/month in 2026**;
  higher earners pay an income surcharge — IRMAA).
- **Part C — Medicare Advantage (MA).** A **private** all-in-one alternative that
  bundles A + B (usually + D), often with extra benefits, but with **networks**
  and **prior auth**. You pick *either* Original Medicare (A+B) *or* Advantage.
- **Part D — Prescription drug coverage.** Private plans; standalone (with
  Original Medicare) or built into an Advantage plan.

**Two routes:** **(A)** Original Medicare (Part A + B) + usually a **Part D** drug
plan + a **Medigap** supplement; or **(B)** a **Medicare Advantage (Part C)** plan.

- **Medigap (Medicare Supplement)** — standardized **private** policies (plans
  labeled by letter) that cover Original Medicare's out-of-pocket gaps
  (coinsurance/deductibles). **Works only with Original Medicare**, not Advantage.

**Enrollment periods & penalties (as of 2026 — verify at medicare.gov):**
- **Initial Enrollment Period (IEP):** a **7-month** window around your 65th
  birthday (the 3 months before, your birthday month, and the 3 months after).
- **General Enrollment Period (GEP):** **Jan 1 – Mar 31** each year, if you missed
  your IEP.
- **Medigap Open Enrollment:** a **6-month** window starting the month you're 65
  **and** enrolled in Part B — your best (guaranteed-issue) shot to buy Medigap.
- **⚠️ Late-enrollment penalties are usually permanent:**
  - **Part B:** **+10% for each full 12 months** you could have had it but didn't
    — added to your premium **for as long as you have Part B.**
  - **Part D:** **1% × the national base premium ($38.99 in 2026) × the number of
    full uncovered months** — added for as long as you have Part D.
  - **Part A** (only if you must *buy* it): up to **+10%**, for twice the number
    of years you delayed.
  - **Special Enrollment Periods** can let you delay penalty-free if you had
    **creditable coverage** (e.g., from an active employer plan).

## Part 6 — Choosing a plan & appealing a denial

### Choosing a plan (a checklist, not a formula)

1. **Estimate your year:** routine + any known surgeries/meds/pregnancy.
2. **Compare total expected cost = premium × 12 + expected cost-sharing**, then
   **stress-test against the OOP max** for a bad-year scenario. Don't shop on
   premium alone.
3. **Check the network** for *your* doctors/hospitals and the **formulary** for
   *your* drugs — on the specific plan.
4. **Apply any subsidies:** if PTC-eligible, see real net premiums; **if
   CSR-eligible, look hard at Silver.**
5. **HSA angle:** want to save tax-advantaged for healthcare and can absorb a
   high deductible? An **HDHP + HSA** may win (Part 3).
6. Read the **Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC)** — a standardized one-pager
   every plan must provide, with example cost scenarios.

### Appealing a denied claim (internal appeal → external review)

If a plan denies a claim or a prior authorization, you have **rights** (ACA-era
protections, as of 2026):

1. **Read the denial** — it must state the reason and how to appeal.
2. **Internal appeal** — you ask the insurer to reconsider. There's a filing
   deadline (commonly **within 180 days** of the denial) and a window for the
   insurer to respond; **urgent/expedited** review exists when delay endangers
   health. Submit supporting documentation (doctor's letter, records).
3. **External review** — if the internal appeal fails, you can take it to an
   **independent third party** whose decision the insurer **must follow.** There's
   a deadline to request it after the final internal denial, with **standard** and
   **expedited** tracks.
4. Keep a paper trail; your **state insurance department** and the marketplace can
   help, and **expedited** paths exist for urgent care needs.

> Exact appeal/external-review **deadlines and decision timelines vary by plan and
> state and have specific day-counts** — confirm yours on the denial letter and at
> **[healthcare.gov/appeal-insurance-company-decision](https://www.healthcare.gov/appeal-insurance-company-decision/)**.
> Note: disputes over the **bill/balance** (vs the coverage *denial*) — including
> surprise-billing and the **No Surprises Act** — are a **`medical-debt-and-billing`**
> topic.
