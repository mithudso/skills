Spoke of the **consumer-finance** family (the personal-money side of the broader
**`consumer-credit-and-debt`** hub). This skill covers where you keep money:
deposit accounts, the insurance behind them, the fees that erode them, and how to
pick and safely use a bank or credit union. It covers scam *prevention* and what
the reimbursement rules are (Section 8), but not borrowing, investing, or the
step-by-step *recovery* after fraud or identity theft. See the cross-references
at the end.

## 1. Deposit account types

| Account | What it's for | Typical traits |
|---|---|---|
| **Checking** | Daily spending, bill pay, debit card, direct deposit | High liquidity; historically little/no interest; may carry monthly fees |
| **Savings** | Short-term reserves / emergency fund | Modest interest; some banks still cap withdrawals by policy |
| **High-yield savings (HYSA)** | Same role as savings, much higher rate | Usually at online banks; rate is **variable** and can drop anytime |
| **Money market account (MMA)** | Savings with limited check/debit access | Rates between savings and HYSA; may have higher minimums |
| **CD / share certificate** | Locking money for a fixed term | Fixed rate; **early-withdrawal penalty**; "share certificate" is the credit-union name |

Key distinctions:

- **HYSA vs MMA.** Both are deposit accounts (insured, variable rate). MMAs add
  limited transactional access (checks/debit). Neither is a *money market fund*,
  which is an **investment** (not deposit-insured). That last point is a common and
  costly confusion.
- **CDs** trade liquidity for a locked rate. A **CD ladder** (staggered maturities)
  balances rate and access. Watch for **auto-renewal** at maturity; there's a short
  grace period (often ~7-10 days) to withdraw penalty-free.
- **"Withdrawal limits."** Federal **Regulation D's** 6-per-month limit on savings
  transfers was **suspended in 2020 and remains optional**, but many banks still
  enforce a limit by their own policy. Check the account's terms.
- A higher **APY** beats a low one mechanically: on $10,000, the gap between 0.40%
  and 4.0% is roughly **$360/year**. For an emergency fund, an HYSA is usually the
  default home.

---

## 2. APY and Truth in Savings (Regulation DD)

**Truth in Savings (TISA), implemented by Regulation DD (12 CFR 1030)**, exists so
you can comparison-shop deposit accounts on uniform terms. (For credit unions the
parallel rule is **NCUA's Truth in Savings, 12 CFR 707**, same substance.)

- **APY (annual percentage yield)** is the standardized number for comparing
  accounts. It bakes in the interest rate **and compounding frequency** over a
  365-day period, so two accounts are directly comparable. **Always compare APY,
  not the nominal "interest rate."**
- An ad that states a return **must** state it as an **"annual percentage yield"**
  using that term. That's a Reg DD requirement, not marketing courtesy.
- Banks must disclose fees, the rate, the APY, and other terms **before you open**
  and **on request**.
- A change that **lowers the APY or otherwise hurts you** requires **≥30 days'
  advance notice** (with limited exceptions, e.g., variable rates tied to an index).
- **Watch the asterisks:** intro/teaser APYs, balance tiers (the headline rate may
  apply only above a threshold, or only *up to* a cap), and required activity
  (direct deposit, debit transactions) to earn the top rate.

---

## 3. Banks vs. credit unions

| | **Bank** | **Credit union** |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership | For-profit, owned by shareholders | **Not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative** |
| Eligibility | Open to anyone | **Must meet a "field of membership"** (employer, geography, association) |
| Deposit insurance | **FDIC** | **NCUA** (NCUSIF) |
| Tendencies | More branches/ATMs, broader products, bigger tech budgets | Often **better rates, lower fees**, more personal service |

Functionally similar for everyday banking. Credit unions frequently offer higher
savings APYs and lower/zero fees because profits return to members; large banks
often win on ATM networks, branch density, and app polish. **Insurance protection
is equivalent**: $250k per the same ownership-category rules (Section 4). Many
people use both (e.g., a credit union for savings, a big bank for a slick app).

---

## 4. Deposit insurance — FDIC vs NCUA (the core section)

Both agencies are backed by the **full faith and credit of the US government** and
provide **identical** coverage mechanics. **FDIC** insures **banks**; **NCUA**
(through the **National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, NCUSIF**) insures
**federally insured credit unions**. At a credit union, deposits are called
**"shares,"** so it's "share insurance," but the math is the same.

### The standard limit

> **$250,000 per depositor, per insured institution, for each account ownership
> category.**

Three multipliers expand coverage: **more depositors**, **more institutions**, and
**more ownership categories**. Deposits at two *separately chartered* institutions
are insured separately. (Note: an online "brand" and its parent may be the **same
charter**, so verify with **FDIC BankFind** / **NCUA Research a Credit Union**
before assuming you've doubled coverage.)

### Ownership categories (each gets its own $250k)

| Category | Coverage |
|---|---|
| **Single** (one owner, no beneficiaries) | $250k total across all single accounts at that bank |
| **Joint** (two+ co-owners, no beneficiaries) | **$250k per co-owner** (a 2-person joint account is insured to $500k) |
| **Certain retirement accounts** (traditional/Roth **IRA**, etc.) | $250k, separate from single accounts — but only the **deposit** portion (a bank CD/savings inside the IRA); **securities** held in a brokerage IRA are not deposit-insured |
| **Trust accounts** (revocable + irrevocable, **merged into one category on April 1, 2024**) | Each owner insured **$250k per beneficiary, up to 5 beneficiaries (max $1.25M per owner)** |
| **Employee benefit plan** | per-participant interest |
| **Corporation / partnership / unincorporated association** | $250k per entity |
| **Government** | per official custodian |

### How to maximize coverage (legitimately)

1. **Spread across institutions**, $250k each at separate charters.
2. **Use different ownership categories** at one bank, e.g., a single account
   ($250k) + your half of a joint account ($250k) + an IRA ($250k) are insured
   separately, so one couple can cover well over $1M at a single bank.
3. **Name beneficiaries** on trust/POD accounts (up to 5 → up to $1.25M per owner).
4. **Sweep / network programs** (e.g., IntraFi/ICS, CDARS) spread large balances
   across many banks to keep each slice under $250k, but understand how the
   program is structured before relying on it.
5. **Use the official calculators:** FDIC **EDIE** and the **NCUA Share Insurance
   Estimator** compute your exact coverage.

### What deposit insurance does NOT cover

Insurance covers **deposits** if the **insured institution fails**. Full stop.
It does **not** cover:

- **Investments**: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, **money market mutual funds**,
  annuities, life insurance, Treasury/municipal securities, even if bought *through*
  the bank.
- **Crypto assets.**
- **Safe-deposit box contents.**
- **Fraud, theft, or scams** you fall victim to (Sections 8-9).
- **The failure or bankruptcy of a nonbank company / fintech** (Section 6).

---

## 5. Account fees & how to avoid them

Banking is far cheaper than it looks if you read the fee schedule:

- **Monthly maintenance fee** is almost always **waivable**: maintain a minimum
  balance, set up qualifying **direct deposit**, link accounts, or pick a free
  account (most online banks and many credit unions charge $0).
- **Overdraft / NSF fees**: the big ones; Section 7.
- **Out-of-network ATM fees**: both the ATM owner and your bank may charge; some
  banks/credit unions rebate them or belong to **surcharge-free networks** (Allpoint,
  Co-op, MoneyPass).
- **Wire transfer fees**, **paper-statement fees**, **early CD-withdrawal penalties**,
  **excessive-withdrawal**, **foreign-transaction**, **dormancy/inactivity**, and
  **account-closing** fees.
- **Tactics:** read the **Truth in Savings disclosure / fee schedule** before
  opening; choose a free or fee-waivable account; keep enough to clear any minimum;
  **opt out of overdraft coverage** (Section 7); use in-network ATMs; and **ask** —
  banks routinely waive a fee on request, especially a first occurrence.

---

## 6. Online banks, neobanks & fintech apps — the pass-through risk

- **Online banks** (e.g., the direct-banking arm of a chartered bank) are usually
  **themselves FDIC-insured banks**. Lower overhead funds higher HYSA rates. Safe
  and standard.
- **Neobanks / fintech apps** are frequently **NOT banks.** A fintech is a tech
  company that *partners* with one or more chartered banks to hold your money.

### The critical distinction (the Synapse lesson, 2024)

> **A fintech app is not itself a bank.** Your money is FDIC-insured only **after**
> the fintech actually places it at an insured bank **and** accurate
> ledgers/records exist to identify your share ("**pass-through insurance**").

**FDIC insurance protects against the failure of the *bank*, not the failure of a
*nonbank* company.** In the **2024 collapse of Synapse** (a banking-as-a-service
middleware firm), end customers of fintech apps were told their funds were
"FDIC-insured," but when Synapse went bankrupt, **reconciliation broke down**:
ledgers didn't match what was actually at the partner banks, and consumers were
**locked out of their money for months**, with some never fully repaid. FDIC
insurance never triggered, because **no bank had failed**, the *nonbank middleware*
failed, which deposit insurance does not cover.

### Practical guardrails

- Find out **which actual FDIC-insured bank(s)** hold the money, and verify them on
  **FDIC BankFind**. If the app can't tell you, treat that as a red flag.
- Read the disclosures to confirm **pass-through** eligibility and that you are the
  recognized owner of record.
- Note any **partner-bank concentration**: if a fintech sweeps your funds to a bank
  where you already hold deposits, the **$250k limit is shared**, not stacked.
- Be wary of apps that advertise insurance loosely or request suspicious permissions.
- FDIC's **2024 proposed "custodial deposit accounts" recordkeeping rule** aims to
  force exactly this ledger accuracy. As of 2026 its status is **uncertain
  (proposed, not finalized)** — verify before relying on it.

---

## 7. Overdraft & NSF fees, and the opt-in rule (Reg E)

- **Overdraft fee**: bank **pays** a transaction that exceeds your balance and
  charges you (historically ~$30-35 each).
- **NSF (non-sufficient funds) fee**: bank **declines/returns** the item and still
  charges you. (Many large banks **eliminated NSF fees** in 2022-2024.)

### The opt-in rule — Regulation E (Reg E)

> For **one-time debit-card and ATM transactions**, a bank **may not charge an
> overdraft fee unless you have affirmatively opted in** ("opt-in"/"affirmative
> consent").

- If you **never opted in**, those transactions are simply **declined** at no cost,
  usually the right setting for most people.
- The opt-in rule **does not** automatically cover **checks and recurring ACH/bill
  payments** (e.g., your electric bill); those can still overdraw and trigger a fee
  regardless of opt-in. Linking a savings account or a small line of credit as
  **overdraft protection** is a cheaper backstop than per-item fees.
- **CFPB Circular 2024-05** warned that charging these fees **without provable opt-in
  consent** can violate the law, so if you were charged and never opted in,
  **dispute it.**

### Regulatory landscape — date-stamp (as of 2026)

The CFPB finalized a rule (**Dec 2024**) that would have forced the **largest
institutions (>$10 billion in assets)** to either cap overdraft at a **benchmark fee
(~$5)**, charge a **breakeven fee** covering only cost, or treat overdraft as
**credit under Truth in Lending (Reg Z)**, effective **Oct 1, 2025**.

> **That rule was repealed.** Congress used the **Congressional Review Act** to
> overturn it; the resolution (**S.J.Res. 18 → Public Law 119-10**) was signed in
> **2025**, so the rule **never took effect.** Large banks may continue charging
> overdraft fees without that cap. The **Reg E opt-in protection (above) still
> stands.** Because the CRA bars a "substantially similar" rule, don't expect a
> federal overdraft *price cap* soon. **Verify the current regulatory state before
> relying on it.**

> Predatory framing of overdraft as a credit product, and payday/high-cost
> alternatives, are out of scope; see **predatory-lending-and-high-cost-credit**.

## 8. Payments: ACH, wire, and Zelle/P2P

| Method | Speed | Reversibility | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ACH** (direct deposit, bill pay, transfers) | 1-3 days (same-day option exists) | Some reversal window for errors | Payroll, bills, account-to-account |
| **Wire transfer** | Same/next day | **Effectively irreversible once sent** | Large/time-critical (home closing) |
| **Instant rails** (**FedNow**, **RTP**) | Seconds, 24/7 | **Final/irreversible once sent** | Real-time pay between banks |
| **Zelle / P2P** (Venmo, Cash App) | Near-instant | **Effectively irreversible; like cash** | Paying people you know |

### Authorized-payment scams — the rule that surprises people

> **If a fraudster makes a transfer from your account without your authorization,
> that's an "unauthorized EFT" and Reg E protects you. But if YOU were *tricked into
> sending the money yourself* (an "authorized" payment), the law generally does NOT
> require the bank to refund you.**

This is the core trap of **Zelle/wire scams** (fake "your account is compromised,
move your money" calls; romance scams; fake invoices). Because **you** initiated the
transfer, banks have historically treated it as authorized and **declined
reimbursement**, and wires/Zelle are **irreversible**.

- **Unauthorized vs. authorized is the whole game.** Reg E (12 CFR 1005) limits your
  liability for **unauthorized** EFTs, especially if you report within **60 days** of
  the statement. Fraudulently *induced* payments you sent yourself fall in a contested
  gap. The **CFPB has pressed banks (and sued some) over Zelle fraud handling**, and
  some networks/banks now reimburse certain **imposter** scams, but **don't count on
  it.**
- **Defense:** treat Zelle and wires like **handing over cash**. Verify the recipient
  through an independent channel. No legitimate bank, agency, or company will tell you
  to "move money to a safe account"; that instruction is itself the scam.
- If hit: **contact your bank immediately** (speed can matter for a wire recall),
  file with the **CFPB** and **FTC (ReportFraud.ftc.gov)**, and report to local police.

---

## 9. ChexSystems & second-chance accounts

- **ChexSystems** is a **consumer reporting agency** (governed by the **FCRA**) that
  banks use to screen checking-account applicants. A history of **unpaid negative
  balances, bounced checks, or fraud** can land you there and get an application
  **denied**.
- **Your FCRA rights:** you're entitled to a **free report** (the bank that denied you
  must tell you which agency it used), and you can **dispute inaccurate information**,
  the agency must **investigate for free** and correct errors. Negative records
  generally age off after **5 years** (ChexSystems' own retention window, shorter
  than the FCRA's general 7-year limit for most negative items).
- **Second-chance accounts** are checking accounts/prepaid products (offered by many
  banks and credit unions) designed for people with a damaged ChexSystems record,
  typically **no overdraft** (so no overdraft fees), sometimes a small monthly fee,
  often graduating to a standard account. Some institutions require clearing old
  unpaid balances first.

---

## 10. Other essentials

- **Joint accounts**: any owner can withdraw the **full balance**; each owner is
  liable; both gain the deposit-insurance benefit (Section 4). Convenient for couples
  but carries trust and (on death/divorce) estate/ownership implications.
- **Account security**: enable **MFA**, set transaction **alerts**, never share
  one-time codes (a bank will never ask for them), and beware "your account is
  compromised" calls (Section 8). *Recovering* from a takeover or identity theft →
  **identity-theft-and-credit-fraud**.
- **Switching banks**: open the new account first, then **move recurring direct
  deposits and autopays**, run both in parallel until everything migrates, then close
  the old account in writing and **keep the closing confirmation** (avoids dormancy
  fees and surprise overdrafts on a forgotten autopay).
- **Unclaimed property**: dormant/abandoned accounts are eventually **escheated** to
  the **state**. You can reclaim them for free via your state treasurer or
  **MissingMoney.com** (the multi-state NAUPA search). Watch for **fake "asset
  recovery" fee** scams.
- **Beneficiaries / POD**: adding a **payable-on-death** beneficiary lets funds pass
  outside probate **and** can raise deposit-insurance coverage (Section 4).
