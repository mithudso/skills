# Student Loans (US)

> **Framing — read first.** This is **general educational information, not financial, tax, or legal advice.** US student-loan policy is **exceptionally volatile (2024-2026)**: the SAVE plan was struck down, the *One Big Beautiful Bill Act* (OBBBA, 2025) is rewriting repayment, and PSLF regulations changed. **Every dollar figure, percentage, plan name, and deadline below is stated "as of 2026" and can change without notice — verify the current rule at [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) before relying on it or advising anyone.** When unsure, send the borrower to studentaid.gov and their loan servicer.

This skill is a **spoke of the `consumer-finance` hub** (note only — do not modify the hub); route there for sibling personal-finance topics (banking, taxes, insurance, budgeting, investing, estate planning). The **`consumer-credit-and-debt`** hub is a **sibling** family — route there for credit-report/score, collections, lending, and consumer-credit-law topics. For neighboring topics see the cross-references at the end.

## 1. Federal vs private — the decision that governs everything

**Federal loans** (US Dept. of Education / Federal Student Aid) carry borrower protections private loans do not: fixed rates set by Congress, income-driven repayment, forgiveness programs (PSLF, IDR forgiveness), generous deferment/forbearance, and death/disability discharge. **Get federal first** by filing the FAFSA.

**Private loans** (banks, credit unions, online lenders) are credit-underwritten, often need a **cosigner**, may carry **variable rates**, and have **no IDR, no PSLF, and no statutory deferment/forbearance**. Discharge on death/disability is at the lender's discretion (many but not all offer it).

> **The refinancing trap (most important single point).** Refinancing **federal loans into a private loan** is permanent and **forfeits all federal protections** — IDR, PSLF, federal forgiveness/discharge, and federal deferment/forbearance. A lower rate rarely justifies losing those for a borrower who might ever need income-driven payments or public-service forgiveness. "Should I refinance?" → only consider it for **private-only** debt, or for a high earner with stable income who will never use federal benefits. (CFPB has cited lenders for *implying* borrowers keep federal benefits after refinancing — they do not.)

## 2. Federal loan types

| Type | Who | Interest in school? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Direct Subsidized** | Undergrad, need-based | **Gov't pays interest** while in school, grace, deferment | Most favorable |
| **Direct Unsubsidized** | Undergrad & grad, no need test | **Borrower owes all interest** from disbursement | Interest capitalizes if unpaid |
| **Direct PLUS — Parent (Parent PLUS)** | Parents of dependent undergrads | Borrower owes all interest | Credit check (adverse-history test); higher rate + origination fee |
| **Direct PLUS — Grad (Grad PLUS)** | Grad/professional students | Borrower owes all interest | **OBBBA eliminates new Grad PLUS loans — verify the cutoff date and new grad borrowing caps** |
| **Direct Consolidation** | Combines multiple federal loans into one | — | Resets some clocks; weighted-average rate (no rate reduction) |

- **Interest rates** are fixed for the life of each loan, set annually by Congress for loans disbursed July 1–June 30. **Look up the current year's rates at studentaid.gov** — do not quote a remembered number.
- **Capitalization** = unpaid interest added to principal (you then pay interest on interest). On unsubsidized/PLUS loans it can occur **after the grace period and at the end of deferment or forbearance**. Avoid it by paying interest as it accrues (e.g., while in school).
- **Annual/aggregate borrowing limits** exist (e.g., dependent undergrad first-year subsidized cap; lifetime undergrad subsidized aggregate). **OBBBA also introduced new borrowing limits — verify current limits at studentaid.gov.**
- **Servicers** collect payments and administer plans: **MOHELA, Aidvantage, Nelnet, EdFinancial** (assignments change). Find yours by logging into **studentaid.gov** → account dashboard. The servicer is who you actually call.

## 3. Repayment plans (the comparison)

> **2026 status — IN FLUX.** A court order **ended the SAVE plan (effective ~March 10, 2026)**; borrowers were moved off it and must pick another plan. Under **OBBBA**, borrowers who take out a **new loan or consolidate on or after July 1, 2026** repay under the new **Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)** or a **Tiered Standard** plan, and legacy IDR plans (ICR/PAYE, and SAVE) are being phased out for them. **Confirm which plans you can actually enroll in today at studentaid.gov/courtactions and studentaid.gov.**

| Plan | Payment basis | Term to payoff/forgiveness | Notes (verify current) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard** | Fixed amount | **10 yrs** (up to 30 if consolidated) | Default plan; lowest total interest; **PSLF-qualifying** |
| **Graduated** | Starts low, rises ~every 2 yrs | 10 yrs (up to 30 consolidated) | Pay more interest overall; generally **not** PSLF-qualifying alone |
| **Extended** | Fixed or graduated, lower payment | Up to **25 yrs** | For ≥ $30k Direct debt; not PSLF-qualifying |
| **SAVE** (IDR) | — | — | **ENDED by court order ~2026** — no longer available; expect migration to IBR/RAP |
| **IBR** (Income-Based) | ~10–15% of discretionary income | **20 or 25 yrs** then forgiven | Statutory; **survives** the litigation; PSLF-qualifying |
| **PAYE** (Pay As You Earn) | 10% of discretionary income | **20 yrs** then forgiven | Being **phased out for new borrowers** under OBBBA |
| **ICR** (Income-Contingent) | Lesser of 20% of discretionary income or a 12-yr fixed amount | **25 yrs** then forgiven | Being **phased out**; only IDR available to Parent PLUS (via consolidation) |
| **RAP** (Repayment Assistance Plan) | Income-based, sliding scale with a **small minimum payment** | Longer term (commonly cited ~30 yrs) then forgiven | **New under OBBBA, ~July 1, 2026** — **verify the exact percentages, minimum payment, and forgiveness term at studentaid.gov** |

- **IDR mechanics:** payment tied to income & family size; **recertify income annually**; spousal income may count depending on plan and tax-filing status; **amount forgiven under IDR can be taxable** (federal tax treatment has changed repeatedly — verify).
- **Use the official Loan Simulator at studentaid.gov/loan-simulator** to compare your actual numbers; it reflects current plan availability better than any static table.

---

## 4. Forgiveness & discharge (federal only)

- **PSLF (Public Service Loan Forgiveness):** **120 qualifying monthly payments** (≈10 yrs) while working **full-time for government or a 501(c)(3) nonprofit**, on **Direct Loans** under a qualifying plan (Standard or IDR). Tax-free forgiveness. **New PSLF regulations took effect ~July 1, 2026 — verify qualifying-employer and payment rules.** Use the **PSLF Help Tool** and submit the employment-certification form annually.
  - **PSLF Buyback:** lets you **pay for past months** that didn't count because you were in an **ineligible deferment/forbearance**, converting them to qualifying payments once you'd otherwise reach 120.
- **IDR forgiveness:** remaining balance forgiven after the plan's full term (**20–25 yrs**, RAP longer) — separate from PSLF, no employer requirement.
- **Teacher Loan Forgiveness:** up to **$17,500** (highly qualified math/science/special-ed; otherwise up to $5,000) after **5 complete & consecutive years** at a qualifying low-income school. Cannot double-count the same service for both TLF and PSLF simultaneously.
- **Borrower Defense to Repayment:** discharge for school **misconduct/misrepresentation** (e.g., fraud). Heavily litigated/paused at times — verify processing status.
- **Closed-School Discharge:** if your school closed while enrolled or shortly after withdrawal.
- **Total & Permanent Disability (TPD) Discharge:** via SSA, VA, or physician certification; also discharges TEACH-grant obligations.
- **Death Discharge:** federal loans (incl. Parent PLUS, on the student's or parent's death) are discharged on proof of death.

> **Bankruptcy is a separate path.** Discharging student loans in **bankruptcy** (the *undue hardship* / Brunner standard, adversary proceeding) is **cross-referenced, not covered here → `bankruptcy-ch7-ch13`.**

## 5. Deferment vs forbearance (temporary relief)

Both **pause payments**; the difference is **who pays interest**:

| | Deferment | Forbearance |
|---|---|---|
| Interest on **subsidized** loans | **Gov't pays it** (doesn't accrue to you) | **You owe it** (accrues) |
| Interest on **unsubsidized/PLUS** | You owe it | You owe it |
| Typical triggers | Enrollment, unemployment, economic hardship, military | Discretionary/general, medical, mandatory categories |

**Rule of thumb:** **prefer deferment** if eligible (free interest subsidy on subsidized loans). Use forbearance only if you don't qualify for deferment, and **pay accruing interest if you can** to avoid capitalization. For long-term affordability, an **IDR plan is usually better than repeated forbearance** (forbearance months generally don't count toward PSLF/IDR forgiveness; certain IDR payments can be **$0** and still count).

---

## 6. Delinquency & default

- **Delinquent** = 1 day past due; reported to credit bureaus typically at **90 days**. **Default** on most Direct Loans = **~270 days** (about 9 months) past due.
- **Consequences of default** (federal, **without a court judgment**):
  - Entire balance **accelerated**; **collection costs** added.
  - **Treasury Offset Program:** seizure of **tax refunds and federal benefits** (including a portion of **Social Security**).
  - **Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG):** ED can order your employer to withhold **up to 15% of disposable pay administratively — no lawsuit or court order required.**
    > **NC note:** North Carolina generally **bans wage garnishment** for ordinary consumer debts, but **federal AWG for student loans bypasses that protection** because it operates under federal law. (NC's general garnishment rules themselves → **`north-carolina-credit-and-debt-law`**.)
  - Loss of eligibility for further federal aid; damaged credit.
- **Getting out of default:**
  1. **Loan Rehabilitation:** agree to and make **9 on-time monthly payments** (income-based, can be modest) over ~10 months. After completion the **default notation is removed** from your credit report (late-payment history may remain). Involuntary collections generally stop after ~5 rehab payments. **One rehab per loan.**
  2. **Consolidation:** combine defaulted loan(s) into a new Direct Consolidation Loan (with 3 on-time payments or by agreeing to IDR) — **faster**, but the **default record stays** on your credit report.
  3. **Pay in full / settlement** (rare).
- **Fresh Start:** the temporary post-pandemic program that auto-restored defaulted borrowers to good standing **ended October 2, 2024.** Don't rely on it; **verify any successor program at studentaid.gov.**

---

## 7. FAFSA & borrowing wisely

- File the **FAFSA** every year (it's free; at studentaid.gov) — it's the gateway to grants, work-study, and federal loans, and many states/schools require it.
- **Borrow only what you need.** Prefer **grants/scholarships → subsidized → unsubsidized → (last) PLUS/private.**
- Favor **federal over private**; keep **subsidized** over unsubsidized when both are offered.
- Know your servicer, keep your **studentaid.gov** login current, and **never pay a company for help** you can get free from your servicer or studentaid.gov (student-loan "debt relief" scams are common — CFPB warns against advance-fee operators).
