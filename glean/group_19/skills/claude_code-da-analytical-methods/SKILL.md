# Data Analysis: Analytical Methods

The analytical-methods stage of the data-analysis discipline — the techniques
that turn a prepared dataset into findings, predictions, and decisions. This is
the "do the analysis" layer that sits between data acquisition and
communication: cleaning and exploring data, fitting statistical and ML models,
running experiments and causal estimates, forecasting, detecting anomalies,
engineering features, and the specialized modeling disciplines (CLV, survival,
Bayesian, conformal/UQ, causal discovery, prescriptive optimization,
recommenders).

It does not re-derive the underlying probability and inference theory (that is
`da-1-foundations-theory`) and it does not own the surrounding process,
platform, or communication stages — see the cross-hub note below.

## How to use this hub

This hub consolidates **16 analytical-methods sub-skills as on-demand
references** under `references/`. Treat the routing table as an index, not as
the answer:

1. Identify which method the task calls for.
2. Find the matching row below.
3. **Read the listed `references/<name>.md` before giving a deep answer** — the
   table lines are deliberately shallow and exist only to route. For
   multi-method tasks (e.g. EDA → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation),
   read each relevant reference in sequence.

## Sub-skill routing table

This hub absorbs 16 former standalone skills as on-demand reference files. When
a task matches a row, **Read the listed `references/` file** before answering —
do not rely on this table alone for depth.

## Cross-hub note

This hub is the *methods* stage of a six-hub data-analytics family. Route
elsewhere when the task is not "run the analysis":

- **Theory beneath a method** (distributions, Bayes' theorem, CLT, estimation
  theory, levels of measurement, correlation vs. causation) →
  `da-1-foundations-theory`.
- **Process / lifecycle** (CRISP-DM, problem framing, success metrics,
  stakeholder handoff) → `da-2-data-analysis-lifecycle`.
- **Getting the data** (sources, collection methods, sampling design) →
  `da-3-data-acquisition-sampling`.
- **Pipelines and platform** (ETL, warehousing, OLAP, semantic layer,
  governance, observability) → `da-data-engineering-platform`.
- **Showing and applying the result** (visualization, reporting, applied/domain
  analytics, ethics and privacy) → `da-applied-and-communication`.
- **Writing up findings** (stakeholder narratives, KB articles, runbooks,
  executive summaries) → `technical-writing-craft` (structured docs) or
  `content-and-marketing-writing` (TAM replies, customer-facing narratives).

When a request spans stages, start in the hub that owns the *decision the user
is currently making* and hand off explicitly.

## Cross-hub map — where every data-analytics topic lives

This family is split across these hubs. If a task's deep material is **not** in this hub's Sub-skill
routing table, it is a reference file under a sibling hub below — **activate that hub or `Read` its
`references/<name>.md` directly**. Every former standalone skill in this family is now a reference under one
of these hubs (nothing was deleted).
