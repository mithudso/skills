# Causal Discovery and Structure Learning

## Overview

**Causal discovery** (a.k.a. structure learning) learns the *causal graph itself*
from observational and/or interventional data — the edges and their directions —
rather than assuming the graph and estimating an effect. This is the upstream
problem to causal **inference**.

- **This skill (discovery):** "What is the causal structure? Which variables
  cause which?" → output is a graph (DAG, CPDAG, or PAG).
- **da-12 (inference):** "Given this DAG, what is the effect of X on Y?" → DiD,
  RDD, IV, propensity scores, synthetic control, backdoor/frontdoor adjustment.

If the user already has/assumes a DAG and wants an effect estimate, defer to
**da-12-ab-testing-causal-inference**. Use this skill only when the *structure*
is the unknown.

The hard truth of discovery: from purely observational data you usually cannot
recover a single DAG — only an **equivalence class** of DAGs (a CPDAG or PAG).
Pinning down direction requires extra assumptions (non-Gaussianity, nonlinearity),
interventions, or time order. Always communicate which edges are oriented vs.
undetermined.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Markov equivalence, CPDAGs, and what is identifiable

Two DAGs are **Markov equivalent** if they entail the same conditional
independences — they have the same skeleton (undirected edges) and the same
**v-structures / colliders** (A → C ← B with A, B not adjacent). Equivalent DAGs
cannot be distinguished by observational independence tests alone (Verma & Pearl,
1990; Andersson, Madigan & Perlman, 1997,
https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-25/issue-2/A-characterization-of-Markov-equivalence-classes-for-acyclic-digraphs/10.1214/aos/1031833662.full).

- A **CPDAG** (Completed Partially Directed Acyclic Graph, a.k.a. essential
  graph) represents the whole Markov equivalence class: directed edges are
  oriented in *every* member, undirected edges flip across members.
- Constraint- and score-based methods return a **CPDAG**, not a DAG. Reporting a
  single oriented DAG from such output is a common, serious error.

### 2. Foundational assumptions (state them, always)

- **Causal Markov condition:** each variable is independent of its
  non-descendants given its parents.
- **Faithfulness:** every conditional independence in the distribution is
  implied by the graph structure (no exact cancellations). Near-violations cause
  unstable orientation in finite samples (Spirtes, Glymour & Scheines, *Causation,
  Prediction, and Search*, 2nd ed., 2000,
  https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262194402/causation-prediction-and-search/).
- **Causal sufficiency:** no unmeasured common causes (latent confounders). PC
  and GES assume this; **FCI does not**.
- **Acyclicity:** most methods assume a DAG (no feedback loops).
- Identifiability hinges on these. Be explicit which the chosen method needs.

## Methodology — algorithm families

### A. Constraint-based (independence-test driven)

- **PC algorithm** (Peter–Clark; Spirtes, Glymour & Scheines, 2000): start from a
  complete undirected graph, remove edges via conditional-independence (CI) tests,
  then orient colliders and propagate (Meek rules). Output: **CPDAG**. Assumes
  causal sufficiency + faithfulness. Order-dependence fixed by **PC-stable**
  (Colombo & Maathuis, 2014, https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/colombo14a.html).
  CI tests: Fisher-Z (linear-Gaussian), G²/χ² (discrete), KCI (kernel, nonlinear).
- **FCI** (Fast Causal Inference) and **RFCI**: drop causal sufficiency — handle
  **latent confounders and selection bias**. Output: a **PAG** (Partial Ancestral
  Graph) over a **MAG**, with edge marks ○ (unknown), → (ancestor), ↔ (latent
  common cause) (Spirtes et al., 2000; Zhang, 2008 — augmented FCI orientation
  rules, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370208001008).

### B. Score-based search

- **GES** (Greedy Equivalence Search; Chickering, 2002,
  https://jmlr.org/papers/v3/chickering02b.html): searches over CPDAG space with a
  two-phase forward (edge-add) / backward (edge-delete) greedy search, scoring with
  a **decomposable, consistent** score — **BIC** (continuous) or **BDeu**
  (discrete). Asymptotically returns the true equivalence class. **fGES** is the
  fast/parallel variant (TETRAD).
- **GIES** (Hauser & Bühlmann, 2012,
  https://jmlr.org/papers/v13/hauser12a.html): GES extended to **interventional
  data** — searches over interventional Markov equivalence classes, exploiting
  experiments to orient more edges.

### C. Permutation / ordering search

- **GRaSP** and **BOSS** (Lam, Andrews & Ramsey, 2022,
  https://proceedings.mlr.press/v180/lam22a.html): search over variable
  *orderings*; more accurate and scalable than GES on many benchmarks, available
  in causal-learn and TETRAD.

### D. Functional causal models (FCMs) — orient beyond the equivalence class

By assuming a functional form, these identify a **unique DAG**, not just a CPDAG.

- **LiNGAM** — Linear, Non-Gaussian, Acyclic Model (Shimizu, Hoyer, Hyvärinen &
  Kerminen, 2006, JMLR 7:2003–2030,
  https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v7/shimizu06a.html): linear SEM with non-Gaussian
  noise → full causal order is **identifiable**. **ICA-LiNGAM** uses ICA;
  **DirectLiNGAM** (Shimizu et al., 2011, JMLR 12,
  https://jmlr.org/papers/volume12/shimizu11a/shimizu11a.pdf) is regression-based
  and avoids ICA local optima.
- **ANM** — Additive Noise Models (Hoyer, Janzing, Mooij, Peters & Schölkopf,
  2008/2009, https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3548-nonlinear-causal-discovery-with-additive-noise-models):
  Y = f(X) + N with N ⟂ X. Nonlinear f breaks the X↔Y symmetry → cause/effect
  direction identifiable.
- **Post-Nonlinear (PNL)** model (Zhang & Hyvärinen, 2009,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2599): Y = g(f(X) + N) — most general identifiable
  FCM. In causal-learn.

### E. Continuous-optimization / gradient methods

Reframe combinatorial DAG search as smooth optimization with a differentiable
acyclicity constraint — scales and integrates with deep learning.

- **NOTEARS** (Zheng, Aragam, Ravikumar & Xing, NeurIPS 2018,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01422): the acyclicity breakthrough —
  `h(W) = tr(e^{W∘W}) − d = 0` is a smooth, exact characterization of acyclicity,
  solved via augmented Lagrangian. Originally linear; NOTEARS-MLP extends to
  nonlinear.
- **GOLEM** (Ng, Ghassami & Zhang, NeurIPS 2020,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10201): likelihood-based score with soft acyclicity —
  faster and more accurate than NOTEARS in the linear-Gaussian/EV setting.
- **DAG-GNN** (Yu et al., ICML 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10098): VAE/GNN
  variant for nonlinear and discrete data.
- **Caveat:** Reisach, Seiler & Weichwein (NeurIPS 2021, "Beware of the Simulated
  DAG", https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13647) showed continuous-optimization methods
  can exploit **varsortability** — marginal-variance artifacts of synthetic data
  scaling. **Standardize data** and don't trust synthetic-benchmark wins blindly.

### F. Time-series causal discovery

- **Granger causality**: X Granger-causes Y if past X improves prediction of Y
  beyond Y's own past. Predictive, not structural; fails with latent confounders /
  instantaneous effects / nonlinearity. Use only as a baseline.
- **PCMCI / PCMCI+** (Runge et al., *Science Advances* 2019,
  https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aau4996; PCMCI+ in UAI 2020,
  https://proceedings.mlr.press/v124/runge20a.html): two-stage — a PC-style
  condition-selection step, then **Momentary Conditional Independence (MCI)** tests
  controlling for autocorrelation and indirect links. PCMCI+ adds contemporaneous
  links. Implemented in **Tigramite**; pairs with any CI test (ParCorr, GPDC, CMI).
  **LPCMCI** handles latent confounders.
- **VAR-LiNGAM** (Hyvärinen et al., 2010,
  https://jmlr.org/papers/v11/hyvarinen10a.html): combines a VAR model with LiNGAM
  to recover both lagged and instantaneous causal effects.

## Tools / Frameworks

- **causal-learn** (py-why, Python; Zheng et al., 2024,
  https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-0970.html;
  docs https://causal-learn.readthedocs.io/): the reference Python toolkit — PC,
  FCI, GES, GRaSP, BOSS, LiNGAM family, ANM, PNL, CD-NOD, plus CI tests and graph
  utilities. Default first choice for general discovery.
- **gCastle** (Huawei Noah's Ark Lab; Zhang et al., 2021,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15155): gradient-based focus (NOTEARS, GOLEM,
  DAG-GNN, GraN-DAG, ...), PyTorch + GPU, data simulators, and a built-in metrics
  module (SHD, FDR, TPR, F1, NNZ).
- **Tigramite** (Runge; https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite): the standard for
  time-series discovery (PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI, RPCMCI).
- **pcalg** (R; Kalisch et al., *JSS* 2012,
  https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v047i11): mature PC/FCI/RFCI/GES with
  IDA effect estimation.
- **DoWhy** (py-why; https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/): primarily inference, but its
  GCM module and `dowhy.causal_discovery` wrap discovery; good for the
  discover-then-refute workflow.
- **CausalNex** (QuantumBlack; https://causalnex.readthedocs.io/): NOTEARS-based
  structure learning + Bayesian-network reasoning, with expert-knowledge
  constraints (tabu edges, required edges).
- **TETRAD / py-tetrad**: large library of search algorithms and the
  knowledge/background-constraint framework.

## Practical Patterns

1. **Always inject background knowledge.** Forbidden edges, required edges, and
   tiered time order (a cause can't follow its effect) dramatically reduce the
   equivalence class. Every major tool supports knowledge/tabu constraints — use
   them.
2. **Match method to assumptions and data type:**
   - Possible latent confounders → **FCI / RFCI** (get a PAG), not PC/GES.
   - Linear + non-Gaussian noise → **DirectLiNGAM** (gets a full DAG).
   - Nonlinear, continuous → **ANM / PNL**, or NOTEARS-MLP / DAG-GNN.
   - Discrete/categorical → score-based with **BDeu**, or G²-test PC.
   - High-dim time series → **PCMCI+**.
   - Have interventions/experiments → **GIES** or interventional NOTEARS.
3. **Standardize/scale continuous variables** before continuous-optimization
   methods to avoid varsortability artifacts.
4. **Bootstrap for edge stability.** Resample, re-run discovery, and report
   edge-presence and orientation frequencies rather than one point graph.
5. **Discover → refute → estimate.** Use discovery to *propose* a graph, validate
   with domain experts and refutation/sensitivity checks, then hand the validated
   DAG to **da-12** for effect estimation. Discovery output is a hypothesis, not
   ground truth.
6. **Evaluate with the right metric:**
   - **SHD** (Structural Hamming Distance): count of edge insert/delete/reverse
     ops to match the truth — lower is better; compare against the CPDAG, not a
     DAG, when methods return equivalence classes.
   - **SID** (Structural Intervention Distance; Peters & Bühlmann, 2015,
     https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1043): counts intervention-distribution errors —
     closer to what matters for downstream effect estimation than SHD.
   - Also F1 / precision / recall on the skeleton, FDR, TPR.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Reporting a single DAG when the method returns a CPDAG/PAG.** Undirected/
  circle-marked edges are genuinely undetermined; orienting them implies
  assumptions you didn't make.
- **Treating Granger causality as structural causality.** It's lagged prediction;
  silent on confounders and contemporaneous effects.
- **Trusting synthetic-benchmark performance of NOTEARS-family methods** without
  standardizing data (varsortability — Reisach et al., 2021).
- **Ignoring latent confounders.** Running PC/GES when unmeasured common causes are
  plausible yields confident but wrong edges. Use FCI or sensitivity analysis.
- **Skipping faithfulness/sufficiency disclosure.** Stakeholders must know the
  result is conditional on assumptions that can't be verified from data alone.
- **Using discovery output directly for policy.** Discovery proposes; it does not
  prove. Validate before acting.
- **Doing effect estimation here.** Backdoor adjustment, IV, DiD, propensity
  scores, synthetic control → **da-12-ab-testing-causal-inference**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Too many undirected edges in the CPDAG:** expected with observational-only
  data. Add background knowledge, use an FCM method (LiNGAM/ANM) if assumptions
  hold, or collect interventional data.
- **Unstable edges across runs/bootstraps:** likely faithfulness near-violations,
  small n, or wrong CI test. Increase data, switch CI test (e.g., KCI for
  nonlinearity), raise the significance threshold's stability via PC-stable.
- **PC gives different graphs depending on variable order:** use **PC-stable**
  (Colombo & Maathuis, 2014).
- **Dense, implausible graph from NOTEARS:** increase the L1 sparsity penalty,
  standardize data, threshold small weights; consider GOLEM.
- **Nonlinear relationships missed:** linear methods (Fisher-Z PC, linear NOTEARS,
  LiNGAM) can't see them — use KCI tests, ANM/PNL, NOTEARS-MLP, or DAG-GNN.
- **Time-series links look confounded by autocorrelation:** that's exactly what
  **PCMCI** (MCI step) controls for; plain Granger does not.
