# V8 Engine Internals

V8 is Google's open-source JavaScript/WebAssembly engine (C++) powering Chrome, Node.js, Deno, Electron,
and Edge. Performance comes from three coupled subsystems: a **hidden-class object model** that gives
dynamically-typed objects predictable, comparable shapes; an **inline-cache + multi-tier JIT** that
speculatively specializes hot code on observed shapes; and **Orinoco**, a mostly-concurrent generational
garbage collector that keeps pause times low. The three are inseparable — the JIT speculates on hidden
classes via inline-cache feedback, and bad shapes (megamorphism) defeat both the IC and the optimizer.

---

## 1. Object model: Maps (hidden classes), transitions, and property storage

JavaScript has no static classes, so V8 synthesizes them. Every object holds, as its first word, a pointer
to a **Map** (V8's internal name for a *hidden class*; also called a "shape"). The Map describes the
object's structure — which properties exist, their order, their storage location, and attributes.

- **DescriptorArray** — lists a Map's properties with metadata and storage offset. Multiple Maps can
  *share* one DescriptorArray by tracking how many leading descriptors each Map "owns," because property
  insertion order is preserved.
- **TransitionArray** — the edges between Maps: "from Map A, adding property `x` → Map B." Adding a
  property doesn't mutate the Map; it *transitions* to (or creates) a new Map.
- **Transition tree** — objects that receive the same properties **in the same order** walk the same
  chain of Maps and end up sharing the terminal Map. This is what makes them "the same shape" and lets the
  IC/JIT treat them identically.

**Property storage:**
- **In-object properties** — stored inline in the object's own memory slots; fastest access. V8 pre-reserves
  a number of in-object slots based on the constructor.
- **Property backing store ("fast properties")** — once in-object slots are exhausted, extra named
  properties spill to a separate `properties` array, still described by the Map (offset lookup).
- **Dictionary mode ("slow properties")** — if an object is mutated pathologically (many deletes, huge
  sparse key sets), V8 abandons the hidden class and falls back to a hash-table dictionary. This kills IC
  optimization for that object. Deleting a property with `delete` is a common trigger.
- **Elements** — integer-indexed properties are tracked separately as *elements kinds* (e.g.
  `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS`, `PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS`, `PACKED_ELEMENTS`, and `HOLEY_*` variants). Creating
  "holes" (sparse arrays, `arr[100]=x` on a short array, `delete arr[i]`) transitions to a slower HOLEY
  kind that never transitions back.

**Why initialization order matters:** initialize all of an object's properties in the **same order**, ideally
in the constructor, so every instance shares one transition chain. Adding properties out of order (e.g.
inserting `rating` between `name` and `height` on some instances but not others) *bifurcates* the
transition tree, producing distinct Maps for structurally identical objects — which turns a monomorphic
call site polymorphic or megamorphic downstream.

---

## 2. Inline Caches (ICs) and the monomorphic → polymorphic → megamorphic ladder

A property access (`obj.x`), method call, or operator is compiled with an **inline cache**: a per-site
cache of "for Map M, property `x` lives at offset N." On the next hit with the same Map, V8 skips the
full lookup and loads directly. ICs are the primary *type-feedback* source the optimizing tiers consume.

IC states for a site, in order of degradation:

| State | Shapes seen | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Uninitialized** | 0 | No feedback yet (premonomorphic on first hit). |
| **Monomorphic** | 1 | Single Map cached → one map-check + direct offset load. The fast, optimizable case. |
| **Polymorphic** | 2–4 | Small inline list of (Map → handler); linear chain of map checks. Still optimizable, slower. |
| **Megamorphic** | >4 | V8 gives up per-site caching and falls back to a shared global megamorphic stub / hashtable probe. The optimizer largely can't specialize the site. |

**Practical implications**
- Keep call sites **monomorphic**: feed a given function objects of one shape. A function that handles
  many shapes (e.g. a generic serializer over heterogeneous objects) tends toward megamorphic and stays
  slow even when hot.
- Polymorphism of 2–4 shapes is acceptable; the cliff is at megamorphic.
- The optimizing compilers (Maglev/TurboFan) read IC feedback: monomorphic → emit a single map-check fast
  path with inlined load and (for `const` fields) inlined values; polymorphic → a check chain; megamorphic
  → generic, unoptimized access.
- `Function.prototype` shape stability matters: monkey-patching prototypes after instances exist invalidates
  ICs and forces re-learning.

---

## 3. The JIT tiering pipeline: Ignition → Sparkplug → Maglev → TurboFan

V8 is no longer "interpreter + one optimizer." Since 2021–2023 it runs **four tiers**, escalating a
function as it gets hotter and gathering feedback at every step.

1. **Ignition (interpreter, since 2016)** — all JS is first compiled to compact **bytecode** and
   interpreted. Ignition's register machine collects type feedback (in *feedback vectors*) and tracks
   shapes/IC states. Bytecode also keeps memory low (it replaced caching full baseline machine code).
2. **Sparkplug (baseline JIT, 2021)** — a *non-optimizing* compiler that translates bytecode to machine
   code in a single linear pass with **no IR and no optimization**, so compilation is extremely fast. It
   removes interpreter dispatch overhead. Roughly **~2× faster** than Ignition for warm code; the machine
   code stays compatible with the interpreter's stack frame so on-stack replacement is cheap.
3. **Maglev (mid-tier optimizing JIT, GA 2023–2024)** — an **SSA-based compiler over a CFG (control-flow
   graph)**, *not* sea-of-nodes. A minimal set of passes and a simple IR make it **~10× slower than
   Sparkplug but ~10× faster than TurboFan**, producing solidly optimized code without TurboFan's compile
   cost. It uses IC feedback to emit specialized SSA nodes, inserts map/shape checks, inlines de-facto
   constant globals, and exploits "stable" feedback (shape transitions never observed) and "unstable"
   feedback (just-allocated objects that can skip write barriers). Targets warm-to-hot code and hot loops
   that don't yet justify TurboFan. ~5× over baseline on hot code.
4. **TurboFan (top-tier optimizing JIT)** — the heavyweight, using a **"sea of nodes"** IR. It performs
   aggressive speculative optimizations: type specialization, inlining, escape analysis, redundancy
   elimination, constant folding of `const` fields, range analysis. Slowest to compile, best code
   (**~10×+** over baseline). Reserved for the very hottest functions; speculation is guarded by deopt
   points.

**Tiering / profile-guided escalation:** functions accumulate an *invocation/loop budget* (interrupt
budget). Crossing thresholds promotes a function to the next tier; **on-stack replacement (OSR)** can swap
a long-running loop into optimized code mid-execution. Recent V8 adds **profile-guided tiering** that uses
profiling to decide *which* tier to jump to (e.g. skip Maglev straight to TurboFan, or stay at Sparkplug)
rather than always climbing one rung at a time. Tiers cache compiled code; very hot code can even persist
across runs in some embedders.

**Where V8 is going (Turboshaft / Turbolev):** **Turboshaft** is V8's newer backend/IR framework
(block-and-edge CFG, cache-friendlier than sea-of-nodes) that TurboFan's later phases have migrated onto.
The **Turbolev** project (in progress, 2025) feeds Maglev's CFG-based IR into the Turboshaft backend,
aiming to eventually replace the classic TurboFan front end. Treat these as direction, not stable API.

---

## 4. Speculative optimization and deoptimization (bailout)

Optimized code is **speculative**: it assumes the shapes/types observed so far keep holding. When an
assumption breaks, V8 must **deoptimize** — discard the optimized code for that function and resume in
Ignition bytecode at the equivalent point.

- **Eager deopt** — the currently-executing optimized code hits a failed assumption (e.g. an object
  arrives with the wrong Map) and bails out immediately.
- **Lazy deopt** — code is invalidated for a *not-currently-running* function (e.g. a global it inlined
  changed); it's unlinked and recompiled on next call. ("Lazy unlinking" defers the cleanup.)
- **Soft deopt** — an optimization was attempted with **insufficient type feedback**; the function bails
  back to gather more feedback, then re-optimizes. Often seen right after forcing
  `%OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall`.

V8 has **~70 deopt reasons** — e.g. `WrongMap`, `NotASmi`, `InsufficientTypeFeedbackForBinaryOperation`,
`OutOfBounds`. Repeated deopt/reopt cycling ("deopt loop") on a hot function is a serious perf bug:
the function never stays optimized.

**Diagnostic flags** (pass via `node --v8-options` names, or use `d8`):
- `--trace-opt` — log which functions get optimized and to which tier.
- `--trace-deopt` — log every deopt with its reason and the function/bytecode offset.
- `--print-opt-code`, `--code-comments` — dump generated machine code with annotations.
- `--trace-ic` — log inline-cache state transitions per site (monomorphic→…→megamorphic).
- `--allow-natives-syntax` enables intrinsics like `%OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall(fn)`,
  `%GetOptimizationStatus(fn)`, `%HasFastProperties(obj)`, `%DebugPrint(obj)` (shows the Map) for
  micro-investigations. Run under `d8` or Node with the flag; never ship with it.

---

## 5. Orinoco: generational garbage collection

**Orinoco** is the umbrella name for V8's modern GC: a **generational, parallel, concurrent, incremental**
collector designed to minimize main-thread pause time. It rests on the **generational hypothesis** — most
objects die young.

**Heap layout**
- **Young generation (new space)** — small; split into two equal **semi-spaces** (From / To). New objects
  allocate here. Also has a "nursery" + "intermediate" sub-generation: surviving one Scavenge promotes an
  object to intermediate, surviving again promotes it to old space.
- **Old generation (old space)** — long-lived objects; collected by the major GC. Plus specialized spaces:
  large-object space, code space, map space, read-only space.

**Minor GC — the Scavenger (Cheney's semi-space copying)**
- Collects only the young generation, frequently and cheaply.
- Live objects in From-space are **evacuated** (copied) to To-space (or promoted to old space); the rest of
  From-space is reclaimed wholesale by flipping spaces. Half the young space is always empty to allow the copy.
- Since V8 6.2 the Scavenger is **parallel** (dynamic work-stealing across helper threads), cutting
  young-gen pause time **~20–50%**.
- **Write barriers** record old→young pointers in remembered sets, so a minor GC never has to scan the
  whole old generation to find roots into the nursery.

**Major GC — Mark-Sweep-Compact (Orinoco's concurrent machinery)**
- **Mark** — trace the object graph from roots to mark all reachable objects. Done largely with
  **concurrent marking** on background threads while JS runs; **incremental marking** interleaves small
  marking steps with execution; write barriers track references mutated during marking. **Black
  allocation** allocates new objects pre-marked-black during marking so they aren't prematurely collected.
- **Sweep** — reclaim dead-object gaps into free-lists (can be concurrent/lazy).
- **Compact** — selectively evacuate/defragment the most fragmented pages (**parallel compaction**); pages
  with many long-lived objects are swept-in-place instead of copied to avoid expensive moves.
- **Idle-time GC** — embedders (e.g. Chrome) can hand V8 idle slices (the ~16.6 ms gaps at 60 fps) to do GC
  proactively. Concurrent marking can cut heavy-workload pauses **up to ~50%**.

Net effect: most GC work happens off the main thread or in tiny incremental slices, so user-visible
stop-the-world pauses are short.

---

## 6. Node.js GC tuning

V8 sizes its heap conservatively; long-running servers and memory-constrained containers usually need
explicit flags. Pass V8 flags directly to `node` (or via `NODE_OPTIONS`).

**Key flags**
- `--max-old-space-size=<MB>` — cap the **old generation**. The classic OOM lever; raise it (e.g. `4096`)
  when you hit `FATAL ERROR: ... JavaScript heap out of memory`. The historical default is ~1.5–2 GB on
  64-bit, but newer Node derives a default from available system memory.
- `--max-semi-space-size=<MB>` — max size of **each** young-generation semi-space (so young space ≈ 2× this).
  Default is small (a few MB). **Raising it (e.g. 16–128 MB) is often the single biggest GC win**: a larger
  nursery means fewer, less-frequent Scavenges and fewer premature promotions to old space — trading a bit
  of RAM for materially less GC CPU. Sweet spots are typically 16–256 MB depending on allocation rate.
- `--min-semi-space-size=<MB>` — initial/floor young size.
- `--expose-gc` — exposes `global.gc()` to force a collection (diagnostics, or reclaiming after a big batch).
  Don't rely on manual GC in production logic; it's mainly for testing/measurement.
- `--trace-gc` / `--trace-gc-verbose` — log every GC with type (Scavenge vs Mark-Compact), durations, and
  heap sizes; the first thing to enable when diagnosing GC pressure.

**Programmatic observation** — use `perf_hooks` `PerformanceObserver` with `entryTypes: ['gc']` to record GC
events (kind: minor/major/incremental/weakcb, duration) in-process; pair with `process.memoryUsage()`
(`rss`, `heapTotal`, `heapUsed`, `external`, `arrayBuffers`) and `v8.getHeapStatistics()` /
`v8.getHeapSpaceStatistics()`.

**Containers / serverless** — V8 doesn't read cgroup limits by default, so it can size the heap for the host,
not the container, and get OOM-killed. Set `--max-old-space-size` to ~75–85% of the container memory limit,
and bump `--max-semi-space-size` for high-allocation services. (Recent Node has better cgroup awareness, but
explicit flags remain the safe play.)

---

## 7. Practical patterns (write V8-friendly JavaScript)

- **Initialize every property in the constructor, in a fixed order.** One transition chain → one shared Map
  → monomorphic ICs. Avoid adding properties after construction.
- **Keep object shapes stable.** Don't `delete` properties (use `obj.x = undefined` or restructure); don't
  add properties conditionally so some instances differ in shape.
- **Keep arrays packed and same-kind.** Don't create holes; don't mix Smis, doubles, and objects in one
  hot array (forces the more general `PACKED_ELEMENTS`/`HOLEY_*` kind). Prefer `push` over sparse index
  assignment.
- **Keep hot call sites monomorphic** (≤4 shapes). For genuinely heterogeneous data, consider per-shape
  specialized functions over one generic megamorphic function.
- **Avoid `arguments` / `with` / `eval` / non-strict sloppy patterns** that historically blocked
  optimization; use rest params instead of `arguments`.
- **Let functions warm up before benchmarking.** Measure steady-state (post-TurboFan), not cold first calls.
- **Pre-size known collections** to reduce backing-store reallocation; reuse objects/arrays to cut young-gen
  allocation churn (fewer Scavenges).
- **Right-size the nursery** (`--max-semi-space-size`) for allocation-heavy services before reaching for
  bigger old space.

---

## 8. Anti-patterns

- **Shape thrash** — mutating object structure in a loop, conditional property addition, or `delete` on hot
  objects → polymorphic/megamorphic ICs and dictionary-mode fallback.
- **Megamorphic dispatch** — one generic function consuming many object shapes; it never specializes even
  when hot.
- **Deopt loops** — an optimized function repeatedly bails out (`WrongMap`, `NotASmi`, type instability) and
  re-optimizes; net slower than staying interpreted. Catch with `--trace-deopt`.
- **Polymorphic/holey arrays** — mixing element kinds or punching holes forces slow element access that
  doesn't recover.
- **Manual `global.gc()` in production** — usually pauses the main thread and hurts more than it helps;
  tune heap sizes instead.
- **Ignoring container limits** — default V8 heap > cgroup limit → silent OOM kill. Always set
  `--max-old-space-size` in containers.
- **Treating Maglev/TurboFan/Turbolev internals as stable API** — flag names, thresholds, and IR details
  change between V8 versions; pin behavior to the V8 version shipped in your Node release.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Investigate / fix |
|---|---|---|
| Hot function unexpectedly slow | megamorphic ICs / never optimized | `--trace-opt --trace-ic`; check `%GetOptimizationStatus`; stabilize shapes |
| Function optimizes then slows repeatedly | deopt loop | `--trace-deopt` → read the reason (`WrongMap`, `NotASmi`); remove the type/shape instability |
| `JavaScript heap out of memory` (OOM) | old space too small / leak | raise `--max-old-space-size`; if it climbs forever, take heap snapshots and hunt the leak (see `references/javascript-node-html-css-debugging-expert.md`) |
| High GC CPU / frequent Scavenges | nursery too small, high allocation churn | `--trace-gc` (count Scavenges); raise `--max-semi-space-size`; reduce per-request allocations |
| Periodic latency spikes | major (Mark-Compact) pauses | `--trace-gc` for "Mark-compact" durations; reduce long-lived garbage; smaller old space / object pooling |
| Container randomly OOM-killed | V8 heap sized for host, not cgroup | set `--max-old-space-size` to ~75–85% of container limit |
| `delete obj.x` made things slow | dictionary/slow-properties mode | avoid `delete`; assign `undefined` or rebuild the object |
