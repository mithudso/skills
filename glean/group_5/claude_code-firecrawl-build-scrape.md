# firecrawl-build-scrape

**Category:** Frontend & Web Development
**Platform:** Claude Code
**Original Path:** claude-code/firecrawl-build-scrape

## Description
Integrate Firecrawl `/scrape` into product code for single-page extraction. Use when an app already has a URL and needs markdown, HTML, links, screenshots, metadata, or structured page output. Prefer this skill over broader crawl patterns when the feature is page-level.

# Firecrawl Build Scrape

Use this when the application already has the URL and needs content from one page.

## Use This When

- the feature starts from a known URL
- you need page content for retrieval, summarization, enrichment, or monitoring
- you want the default extraction primitive before considering `/interact`

## Default Recommendations

- Return `markdown` unless the feature truly needs another format.
- Use `onlyMainContent` for article-like pages where nav and chrome add noise.
- Add waits or other rendering options only when the page needs them.

## Common Product Patterns

- knowledge ingestion from known URLs
- enrichment from a company, product, or docs page
- pricing, changelog, and documentation extraction
- page-level quality checks or monitoring

## Escalation Rules

- If you do not have the URL yet, start with [firecrawl-build-search](../firecrawl-build-search/SKILL.md).
- If content requires clicks, typing, or multi-step navigation, escalate to [firecrawl-build-interact](../firecrawl-build-interact/SKILL.md).

## Implementation Notes

- Keep the integration narrow: one feature, one URL, one extraction contract.
- Treat `/scrape` as the default primitive for downstream LLM or indexing pipelines.
- Request richer formats only when the consumer needs them, such as links, screenshots, or branding data.
