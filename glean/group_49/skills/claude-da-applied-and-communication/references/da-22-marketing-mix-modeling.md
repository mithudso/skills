# Marketing Mix Modeling & Incrementality

MMM is a top-down, regression-based method that uses aggregated time-series data
(spend, impressions, sales) to estimate the incremental contribution and ROI of
each marketing channel, controlling for baseline, trend, seasonality, price, and
promotions. It is privacy-durable (no user-level tracking) and the dominant method
in the post-cookie / post-ATT era. This skill is the marketing-measurement
application layer; for the general causal-inference toolkit see
`da-12-ab-testing-causal-inference`.

The modern measurement stack is a **calibration triad**: MMM frames strategy and
which channels to test, **incrementality/geo experiments** produce ground-truth
causal estimates, and those estimates **calibrate the MMM** (as priors or
likelihood constraints). MTA fills the short-term tactical-optimization gap where
consented user-level signal still exists.

## Core Concepts

### Adstock / carryover
Advertising effect persists and decays over subsequent periods. **Geometric
adstock**: `adstock_t = x_t + alpha * adstock_{t-1}`, where `alpha in [0,1)` is the
retention/decay rate (higher = longer carryover). Often truncated at a max lag
`l_max` (e.g. 4–8 weeks). **Delayed/Weibull adstock** adds a peak-delay parameter
(`theta`) so the effect peaks days after exposure (TV, brand) rather than
immediately — used by Robyn and described in Google's carryover paper.

### Saturation / diminishing returns
Each channel's response is concave: incremental spend buys less incremental
outcome as the channel saturates. Common forms:
- **Hill function** (from pharmacology): `response = x^s / (k^s + x^s)`, with
  shape `s` and half-saturation `k`. Used by Meridian and DeepCausalMMM.
- **Logistic saturation**: used by PyMC-Marketing; `saturation_lam` controls
  curvature.
- **Michaelis-Menten / exponential** variants in other tools.
Adstock is applied **before** saturation: transform spend → carryover → saturated
response → linear coefficient.

### Response curves and budget allocation
The fitted saturation curves yield **diminishing-return curves** per channel. The
optimizer reallocates budget so marginal ROAS is equalized across channels (move
spend from saturated to under-invested channels until marginal returns match).
This — not the historical ROAS point estimate — is the decision-grade MMM output.

### Bayesian MMM
Treats all parameters (baseline, channel betas, adstock `alpha`, saturation shape)
as distributions. Advantages: encodes **priors** from domain knowledge / past lift
tests, produces full **posterior uncertainty** (credible intervals on ROI), and
supports **hierarchical / geo-level** pooling. Sampling via NUTS/HMC (PyMC,
TensorFlow Probability). Frequentist MMM (ridge regression, e.g. Robyn) instead
penalizes coefficients to handle multicollinearity among correlated channels.

## Tools / Frameworks

| Framework | Owner | Engine | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Meridian** | Google (2024, GA early 2025) | Fully Bayesian, hierarchical geo-level (TF Probability) | Reach & frequency modeling for YouTube/video; explicit ROI priors per channel; replaces LightweightMMM. Steeper learning curve. |
| **Meta Robyn** | Meta | Ridge regression + multi-objective (Nevergrad) hyperparameter optimization | Adstock (geometric/Weibull) + Hill/saturation; auto time-series decomposition (trend/season/holiday via Prophet); built-in calibration to experiments; R + Python. |
| **PyMC-Marketing** | PyMC Labs | Fully Bayesian (PyMC) | Logistic saturation + geometric adstock; `add_lift_test_measurements()` for likelihood-based calibration; highly customizable. |
| **LightweightMMM** | Google | Bayesian (NumPyro) | **Deprecated** — superseded by Meridian; avoid for new work. |

**Choosing:** largest spend on Google → Meridian integrates more easily; largest
spend on Meta → Robyn. Prefer Bayesian (Meridian/PyMC-Marketing) when you have
priors/lift tests to fold in or need uncertainty quantification; Robyn for fast,
non-technical, decomposition-heavy workflows.

## MTA vs MMM (and the unified view)

| Dimension | MTA (Multi-Touch Attribution) | MMM (Marketing Mix Modeling) |
|---|---|---|
| Data | User-level journeys, deterministic IDs | Aggregated time series |
| Granularity | Per touchpoint, near real-time | Channel/campaign, weekly/daily |
| Scope | Digital, trackable only | All channels incl. offline (TV, OOH, print) |
| Privacy | Fragile — breaks under ATT / cookie loss | Durable — no user tracking |
| Horizon | Short-term tactical optimization | Long-term strategic allocation |
| Causality | Correlational (rule/algorithmic credit) | Quasi-causal via regression + controls |

Treating these as either/or is outdated. **Unified Marketing Measurement (UMM)**
combines MMM (strategy) + MTA (tactics) + experiments (ground truth). Neither MTA
nor MMM is causal by itself — only experiments are; experiments calibrate both.

## Incrementality & geo experiments

**Incrementality** = the causal lift attributable to advertising vs. a
counterfactual where it never ran (not the same as last-click attributed
conversions, which include organic/baseline demand).

**Geo experiments (GeoLift / geo-lift)** are the practical gold standard:
- Markets (DMAs, regions, ZIPs) are randomized or selected into **treatment**
  (campaign on / spend change) vs **control** (held out).
- A **counterfactual** for treated geos is built from control geos.
  - **Synthetic control** (e.g. Haus, Meta GeoLift): a weighted blend of control
    geos that best matches the treated geo's pre-period trajectory.
  - **TBR (time-based regression)** / **CausalImpact**: Google's Bayesian
    structural time-series builds a counterfactual from control-market series and
    returns lift **with credible intervals**.
- Key outputs: incremental conversions/revenue, **iROAS** (incremental ROAS),
  **iCPA**, and confidence/credible bounds.
- **Power / MDE**: run a pre-test power analysis to pick test length, number of
  geos, and the minimum detectable effect; underpowered tests produce
  inconclusive lift. Account for **delayed conversions** (e.g. long
  consideration windows) by extending the post-period.

**Pitfalls:** spillover/contamination between adjacent geos; too few or poorly
matched control geos; post-hoc tweaking of the analysis window (p-hacking);
ignoring effect size in favor of p-values; insufficient pre-period for the
counterfactual fit.

## Calibrating MMM with experiments

This is where the methods become one system. A geo/lift test gives a **causal**
estimate for a channel; feed it back into the MMM so the model's belief about that
channel is anchored to reality.

Two mechanisms:
1. **ROI/ROAS priors** (Meridian): set each channel's ROI prior from past lift
   tests, benchmarks, or experiments; the Bayesian model shrinks toward them when
   the time series is weak/collinear.
2. **Likelihood-based saturation calibration** (PyMC-Marketing
   `add_lift_test_measurements()`): each lift test contributes
   `{channel, x (pre-test spend), delta_x (spend change), delta_y (measured sales
   change), sigma (uncertainty)}` — effectively two points on the channel's
   saturation curve. The framework adds these as constraints on the saturation
   function itself, so **more lift tests at different spend levels keep improving
   the curve**, not just one anchored ROAS point.

Operating cadence: at least one lift/geo test per major channel per quarter;
re-calibrate the MMM and review diagnostics on that cadence.

## Privacy-era / post-cookie measurement

- **iOS ATT** (App Tracking Transparency) and **Chrome third-party cookie
  deprecation** gutted user-level tracking → MTA degraded, MMM and experiments
  resurged because they need no individual identifiers.
- **Data clean rooms** (e.g. Google ADH, Amazon Marketing Cloud, retail-media
  clean rooms) allow privacy-safe joins of advertiser + platform data for
  aggregated lift/incrementality measurement without exposing PII.
- Durable stack: MMM (durable, no PII) + geo/lift experiments (causal truth) +
  clean-room aggregated measurement + consented first-party data, with MTA only
  where consent persists.

## Practical Patterns

- **Transform order:** spend → adstock (carryover) → saturation → linear term.
  Getting the order wrong inverts the economics.
- **2–3 years of weekly data** typical; ensure spend variation per channel (a
  channel with flat spend is unidentifiable).
- **Decompose first:** isolate baseline (trend, seasonality, holidays, price,
  promo, distribution) so media coefficients capture *incremental* media effect.
- **Validate with holdout / time-series CV and NRMSE / R²**; check residuals.
- **Calibrate, then optimize:** anchor channels to experiments before trusting the
  budget optimizer's reallocation.
- **Report uncertainty:** present credible intervals on ROI, not point estimates,
  to set decision risk.
- **Quarterly experiment cadence** keeps the MMM honest as creative, audiences,
  and saturation shift.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Treating MTA last-click as incrementality** — it credits demand that would
  have converted anyway; inflates ROAS on bottom-funnel/retargeting.
- **Skipping calibration** — uncalibrated MMM ROIs are easily confounded by
  collinear channels (TV and search rising together) and will misallocate budget.
- **Over-trusting the optimizer** beyond the observed spend range — saturation
  curves extrapolate poorly; cap reallocation to a sane band of historical spend.
- **Ignoring carryover** — fitting media to same-week sales only understates TV /
  brand and overstates fast-response channels.
- **Reusing LightweightMMM for new builds** — deprecated; migrate to Meridian.
- **One-and-done MMM** — a model not re-fit/re-calibrated drifts within a quarter.
- **Underpowered geo tests** — running a test too short or with too few geos
  yields wide intervals and an inconclusive read presented as "no lift."

## Troubleshooting

- **Implausible / negative channel ROI** → multicollinearity; add experiment
  priors, drop/aggregate correlated channels, or use ridge (Robyn) / stronger
  Bayesian priors.
- **Saturation curve looks linear (no diminishing returns)** → insufficient
  high-spend observations; add lift tests at higher spend, or constrain priors.
- **MMM and lift test disagree** → trust the experiment; recalibrate. Persistent
  gaps suggest omitted controls or wrong adstock length.
- **Geo test inconclusive** → re-run power analysis; lengthen post-period for
  delayed conversions; verify control geos match the pre-period; check for
  spillover.
- **Posterior won't converge (high R-hat, divergences)** → tighten priors,
  reparameterize, increase samples; check for collinear predictors.
