# Teaching Troubleshooting & Diagnostic Reasoning

Expert reference for designing instruction and developing learner competency in **troubleshooting and diagnostic reasoning** — the pedagogy of fault-finding, not fault-finding itself.

## When to use vs. adjacent skills

| Task | Use this skill | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| Design training so engineers can diagnose production faults | Yes | — |
| Diagnose a live Atlas performance issue | No | atlas-diagnostics-expert |
| Debug actual code or a software defect | No | software-engineering-patterns |
| Understand CLT, spaced repetition, or retrieval practice mechanisms | Ref only | applied-psychology |
| Backtest competing diagnosis methodologies against case resolutions | No | diagnosis-methodology-backtest |
| Evaluate LLM/agent diagnostic quality with evals or rubrics | No | eval-driven-development |

## Output format guidance

When this skill is invoked, responses should take the form appropriate to the request:

| Request type | Output shape |
|---|---|
| Curriculum design | Phased progression table (system model → worked examples → faded practice → productive failure → assessment) |
| Scenario / fire-drill design | Scenario brief: fault description + learning objective + observation checklist + debrief guide |
| Diagnosing a struggling training program | Root-cause table: symptom → likely instructional gap → remedy |
| Coaching an instructor | Coaching moves list keyed to the six cognitive-apprenticeship methods |
| Assessment design | Key-feature problem template + rubric domains |

## Quick Reference Decision Tables

### Which framework fits your instructional goal?

| Goal | Framework | Key Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Expert makes thinking visible to learner | Cognitive Apprenticeship — Modeling | Externalize internal reasoning via think-aloud |
| Learner needs supported practice with real faults | Cognitive Apprenticeship — Coaching + Scaffolding | Contingent feedback; fade as competence grows |
| Learner has no mental model of the system | System/Mental Model Instruction (Jonassen) | Topographic → functional → strategic → procedural layers |
| Learner can regurgitate procedures but cannot transfer | Productive Failure — Phase 1 | Generate-and-explore before consolidation |
| Learner needs pattern-recognition depth | Illness Script / Schema Building | Case variation; contrast and compare script features |
| Team needs collective failure vocabulary | Game Day / Fire Drill as Learning | Structured chaos injection with structured debrief |
| Assessing diagnostic competency | Key-Feature Problems + Scenario Rubrics | Focus on critical decision steps, not encyclopedic recall |

### Novice-to-Expert Diagnostic Reasoning Trajectory

| Stage | Reasoning Mode | Dominant Strategy | Knowledge Structure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Novice | Hypothetico-deductive (H-D) only | Exhaustive hypothesis testing; slow | Disconnected facts; no fault schemas |
| Intermediate | Mixed | Emerging pattern recognition; still over-tests | Partial illness/fault scripts |
| Advanced Beginner | Hybrid | Pattern recognition for familiar; H-D for novel | Richer scripts; chunked subsystems |
| Expert | Predominantly pattern recognition | Fast schema activation; H-D for edge cases | Encapsulated, interconnected scripts |

*H-D = hypothetico-deductive. Dual-process theory (System 1 fast/non-analytic vs. System 2 slow/analytic) explains this shift — see Core Concept 6. For the psychological mechanisms of expertise and learning, see applied-psychology.*

### Pedagogical Progression for a Troubleshooting Curriculum

| Phase | Instructional Method | Scaffold Level | Learner Activity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — System Knowledge | Conceptual model instruction + simulation | High | Build topographic + functional understanding |
| 2 — Worked Examples | Full expert walk-through with think-aloud | High | Observe, predict, compare to expert |
| 3 — Faded Examples | Backward fading — last steps removed first | Decreasing | Complete increasingly larger portions |
| 4 — Productive Failure | Novel problem before solution shown | None | Generate and explore; fail productively |
| 5 — Consolidation | Expert debriefs learner-generated solutions | Moderate | Compare own vs. canonical; articulate gaps |
| 6 — Independent Practice | Complex, varied cases; coach available | Low | Solve; self-monitor; seek help only at impasse |
| 7 — Assessment | Key-feature problems; scenario rubrics | None | Demonstrate critical decision steps |

## Diagnosing a Failing Training Program

When a running program is underperforming, map symptoms to instructional root causes before redesigning:

| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Remedy |
|---|---|---|
| Engineers follow guides but fail on novel faults | No system/mental model instruction (Phase 1 missing) | Add topographic + functional model before case practice |
| Learners take many unnecessary tests before isolating | Procedural over-teaching; strategy layer absent | Teach split-half and constraint-seeking strategies explicitly |
| Skills work in class but not in production | Transfer failure from low-fidelity scenarios | Increase scenario authenticity; vary case surface features |
| Learners freeze at impasse during incidents | No productive-failure or impasse experience | Add Phase 4 gen-and-explore before showing canonical solution |
| Cannot explain their own reasoning under pressure | Articulation and reflection phases missing | Add structured diagnostic logs; post-case think-aloud debrief |

## Core Concept 1 — Cognitive Apprenticeship Applied to Troubleshooting

Collins, Brown & Newman (1989) provide the foundational framework. The six methods apply directly to teaching diagnosis:

**Modeling**: The expert diagnoses a live or simulated fault while making reasoning visible. In troubleshooting, this requires externalizing normally invisible processes: "I'm seeing high CPU and slow queries together — that pattern makes me think either a missing index or lock contention before I look at anything else." Think-aloud protocol is the vehicle. Without externalization, novices only see the *actions*, not the *reasoning strategy* that chose those actions.

**Coaching**: The instructor observes the learner in the act of diagnosing and provides contingent, just-in-time feedback. Coaching in diagnostic contexts includes:
- Ask the learner to state their hypothesis before running any test
- Probe what evidence would falsify the current hypothesis
- Interrupt random-action patterns by returning to the hypothesis-first discipline
- Guard against premature closure on the first plausible explanation

**Scaffolding**: Reducing task complexity so the learner can engage with the diagnostic reasoning without being overwhelmed by system complexity. Scaffolding instruments for troubleshooting: simplified system models, fault-isolation guides, pre-populated hypothesis lists, structured troubleshooting worksheets. A key principle: *scaffolding must be contingent* — it must respond to where the learner actually is, not be a fixed template applied to everyone.

**Fading**: Removing scaffolds as competence grows. In troubleshooting training: guide-based fault isolation → structured worksheet → open-ended diagnosis. The expertise reversal effect (Kalyuga) warns that scaffolds left too long become harmful for advancing learners — they create extraneous cognitive load rather than reducing it.

**Articulation**: Having learners explicitly state their reasoning — "what do you know, what do you think, why?" Articulation forces the learner to surface tacit reasoning and exposes gaps invisible to the instructor. Techniques: verbal think-aloud, written diagnostic reasoning logs, structured debrief ("what made you suspect X before you tested it?").

**Reflection**: Comparing one's own diagnostic process to an expert's. In practice: post-case debrief with expert trace side-by-side; asking "where did your path diverge from the expert's and why?". Reflection accelerates schema development because it highlights the *structural features* of cases rather than surface features.

**Exploration**: Encouraging learners to generate their own diagnostic approaches, vary parameters, and build their own fault taxonomy. This is the autonomy phase — not free-for-all, but purposeful exploration of the problem space beyond the taught cases.

## Core Concept 2 — Mental Model and System Model Instruction

Jonassen & Hung (2006) identified the core failure mode of traditional troubleshooting instruction: teaching procedures without system understanding produces technicians who can follow guides but cannot transfer to novel faults.

Effective troubleshooting requires a **multi-layered conceptual model** of the system:

1. **Topographic knowledge**: What components exist; how they are physically/logically connected. Learners need this map before they can reason about where a fault could originate.
2. **Functional knowledge**: What each component does; how components interact; causal flow through the system. This is the prerequisite for hypothesis generation — you can only hypothesize causes you understand.
3. **Strategic knowledge**: How experts reason about this class of systems — which fault hypotheses to eliminate first (split-half strategy), which observations rule out whole subsystems, what "normal" looks like at each measurement point.
4. **Procedural knowledge**: The steps for performing diagnostic tests. This is often *over-taught* at the expense of the above — HYDRIVE's field evaluation showed that novice and expert technicians had similar procedural knowledge but radically different strategic knowledge.

**Instructional implication**: System/conceptual model instruction must precede case-based practice. A learner who cannot reason about *why* a symptom implicates a subsystem cannot benefit from observing an expert diagnose it.

**Causal reasoning as a bridge**: Learners must develop causal chains — "if component X fails, what are the observable consequences downstream?" Teaching from failure effects backward to causes (consequence-to-fault mapping) produces better transfer than teaching from component knowledge forward.

## Core Concept 3 — Productive Failure and Impasse-Driven Learning

Kapur (2008, 2014, 2015) demonstrated that having learners struggle with a problem *before* instruction is more effective for deep learning than instruction-first. The mechanism is **activation and differentiation of prior knowledge** — learners who have attempted to solve the problem attend differently to the expert solution because they have generated contrast cases to compare against.

**The two-phase Productive Failure design**:
- *PF Generation phase*: Learners work on a complex novel fault with no scaffolding. They will typically fail to find the canonical solution. The failure is *productive* because it activates relevant prior knowledge, forces attention to critical conceptual features, and creates a knowledge deficit the learner is motivated to fill.
- *PF Consolidation phase*: Expert consolidates the learner-generated solutions — showing what each attempt got right, what it missed, and why the canonical approach is superior. This comparison-based consolidation builds deeper schemas than explanation alone.

**VanLehn's impasse-driven learning** (2003): Learning events concentrate at *impasses* — moments when the learner's current approach fails and no next step is available. Providing the answer before the learner reaches impasse eliminates this learning opportunity. Implication for coaching: resist the urge to intervene before the learner is genuinely stuck.

**Design principles for troubleshooting Productive Failure**:
- Cases must be complex enough to challenge but not frustrate (require prior knowledge to engage with)
- Multiple plausible diagnostic paths should exist
- Phase 1 group work amplifies effect — learners generate a richer diversity of attempts
- Phase 2 must systematically compare learner attempts to the expert approach, not just present the answer

## Core Concept 4 — Fault Diagnosis Instruction: Novice-to-Expert Trajectory

Research on expert-novice differences in technical troubleshooting (Johnson 1988; Rasmussen 1974, 1993) reveals:

**How experts differ from novices in fault diagnosis**:
- Experts chunk symptoms into higher-order patterns; novices process each symptom individually
- Experts use constraint-seeking strategies (tests that eliminate whole subsystems at once); novices use hypothesis-scanning (test one fault at a time)
- Experts maintain a fault model of the system state and update it with each test; novices lose track of what has been eliminated
- Expert pattern recognition in familiar domains is fast and non-analytic (System 1); novel problems force a switch to hypothetico-deductive reasoning (System 2)
- Experts selectively seek information with a strategy; novices collect broadly without prioritization

**Instructional implications**:
- Teach the *strategy* layer explicitly: split-half strategy, working from most-likely to least-likely, eliminating subsystems before components
- Use process tracing (think-aloud, diagnostic logs) to reveal the strategy being used, not just the outcome
- Design cases that cannot be solved by memorized procedures — force strategic reasoning
- Build fault schemas explicitly: give learners frameworks for organizing symptoms by subsystem, not just checklists

**The HYDRIVE lesson** (Gitomer, Steinberg, Mislevy): HYDRIVE was an intelligent tutoring system for F-15 hydraulic systems troubleshooting. The ITS that taught strategic and system knowledge outperformed procedure-focused tutoring precisely on novel problems — the ones that matter most in real operations.

## Core Concept 5 — Worked Examples and Faded Scaffolding for Troubleshooting

For the cognitive load theory mechanisms underlying this section (working memory limits, intrinsic vs. extraneous load, schema formation), see applied-psychology. Below are the instructional applications specific to troubleshooting:

**Full worked examples** are optimal for novices because they free working memory for observing the reasoning structure rather than searching for a solution. For troubleshooting, a worked example is an annotated expert trace: symptom → hypothesis generated → test chosen → result → hypothesis updated → repeat.

**Faded worked examples** (Renkl, Atkinson, Sweller): Gradually remove steps from the expert trace, starting from the *last* steps (backward fading). The learner completes increasingly larger portions of the diagnosis. This is more effective than alternating full examples with full problems because it maintains coherence of the diagnostic chain.

**Expertise reversal effect**: As learners gain expertise, full worked examples become redundant and impose extraneous load. The fading schedule must adapt to the learner — not be fixed by session count.

**Application to troubleshooting curriculum design**:
1. First cases: complete expert trace with full annotation
2. Next cases: expert trace with final steps removed ("what do you test next and why?")
3. Later cases: expert trace with most steps removed — learner drives with only the initial symptom and the ability to request hints
4. Final cases: independent diagnosis; worked trace available only after learner commits to an answer

Van Gog et al. (2006) confirmed in electrical circuit troubleshooting: novices learn more from studying worked examples than solving equivalent problems; the advantage inverts as expertise grows.

## Core Concept 6 — Clinical Reasoning Education Crossover

Medical diagnostic reasoning education is the most developed field for teaching diagnosis. Its methods transfer directly to technical troubleshooting.

**Illness scripts** (Schmidt & Boshuizen; Charlin et al.): Expert clinicians organize disease knowledge into *illness scripts* — mental representations binding enabling conditions (risk factors, context), fault (pathophysiology), and consequences (signs, symptoms, test findings). Novice knowledge is fragmented; expert knowledge is bundled into retrievable, comparable scripts.

**Teaching with illness scripts**:
- Teach learners to *construct* fault scripts for each failure mode (not just memorize symptoms)
- Use case variation to *elaborate* scripts — same fault in different contexts
- Use *contrast cases* — two faults with overlapping symptoms — to force script differentiation
- Script-based reading: guide learners to organize new information by script structure, not linear chapter order

**Dual-process theory**: System 1 (fast, pattern-based, non-analytic) vs. System 2 (slow, hypothetico-deductive, analytic). Expert performance is not just more System 1 — it is *appropriate calibration*: using pattern recognition for familiar fault profiles, switching to analytic reasoning for novel or ambiguous presentations. This is distinct from System 1/2 as a psychology of cognition (see applied-psychology); here the focus is on teaching learners *when to switch systems*.

**Key-feature problems** (Norman & Feightner 1995): Assessment format that focuses on critical decision steps rather than encyclopedic recall. A key-feature problem presents a realistic fault scenario and asks only 2–3 questions targeting the decisions that actually determine diagnostic success. Directly applicable to IT/SRE troubleshooting assessment.

## Core Concept 7 — Simulation and Game Days as Teaching Vehicles

Simulation and controlled chaos injection are *pedagogical* vehicles when designed with learning objectives and structured debriefs — not just evaluation or operational exercises.

**What makes simulation-based troubleshooting learning effective**:
- Fidelity sufficient to activate relevant schemas (not perfect realism — realism is expensive and often unnecessary)
- Controllable fault injection — instructors set the fault type and observe learner behavior
- Safe failure — learners make diagnostic errors without real consequences
- Structured debrief immediately after — this is where learning consolidates

**Game days as structured learning events** (not just operational tests):
- *Pre-brief*: establish learning objectives, not just operational goals
- *Scenario design*: choose fault types that expose known gaps in learner mental models
- *Observation protocol*: track time to hypothesis, tests chosen, when learner calls for help
- *Debrief structure*: compare learner trace to expert trace; discuss the *reasoning*, not just the answer

**ITS lessons (HYDRIVE, SHERLOCK, ITADS)**: Intelligent tutoring systems for troubleshooting that proved most effective combined simulation (realistic fault environment) with adaptive coaching (just-in-time hints keyed to the learner's current strategy) and after-action review. HYDRIVE (Gitomer, Steinberg & Mislevy) targeted F-15 hydraulics; SHERLOCK (Lesgold et al.) targeted avionics test stations; ITADS (Ramachandran et al., 2018) targeted US Navy IT network troubleshooting. All three outperformed procedure-only instruction on transfer problems. Full citations in `references/teaching-troubleshooting-diagnostic-reasoning.md`.

**Fire drills as learning**: Netflix/Amazon game days work pedagogically because: (1) they create authentic impasses in a safe context, (2) team members see collective and individual gaps they would not discover through procedures alone, (3) structured post-mortems force articulation and reflection. Design fire-drills with the cognitive apprenticeship loop: expert narrates what they're thinking during the drill; debrief elicits comparison; next drill removes one scaffold.

## Core Concept 8 — Assessment of Diagnostic Skill

*This section covers domain-specific diagnostic assessment instruments (key-feature problems, script concordance, scenario rubrics). For certification exam psychometrics, IRT, cut scores, or item bank design, see assessment-certification-design.*

**Key-Feature Examinations**: Case scenario + 2–3 questions targeting only the critical decision steps. Scoring keys accept multiple correct responses (reflecting realistic diagnostic flexibility). High content validity; resists rote memorization.

**Script Concordance Test (SCT)**: Presents partial fault scenario with new evidence and asks how that evidence changes the probability of a given hypothesis. Scores learner responses against an expert panel. Measures *diagnostic reasoning process*, not just endpoint accuracy.

**Scenario-based rubrics**: Rubrics that assess the reasoning process — hypothesis generation quality, efficiency of test selection, appropriate updating of hypotheses with evidence, recognition of red flags. Rubric domains aligned with the Diagnostic Competency framework (Daniel et al.): information gathering, hypothesis generation, problem representation, differential generation, leading diagnosis, justification, management.

**Process tracing as formative assessment**: Think-aloud protocols, diagnostic logs, and simulation traces reveal the strategy the learner is using — visible to the instructor and to the learner during reflection. More diagnostic (appropriately) than outcome scores alone.

**Common assessment pitfalls for troubleshooting**:
- Assessing only the correct answer, not the reasoning path
- Using cases solvable by procedure-following without reasoning
- Testing in conditions too different from training (context specificity)
- Over-reliance on self-report without behavioral evidence
