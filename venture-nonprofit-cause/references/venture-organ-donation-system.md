# Organ & Tissue Donation: The US System, Policy, and NC Specifics

Educational domain reference for a North Carolina cause venture working on organ, eye, and tissue donation **awareness** and **donor registration**. It explains how the system is structured and governed, how people register, the major policy debates, the myths and equity barriers a campaign must navigate, and the NC-specific law and registry mechanics. It is a knowledge foundation, not medical or legal advice — see the Disclaimer, and always re-verify live numbers and law before publishing.

Quick framing for a venture: in the US you cannot "make" anyone a donor and you do not run the recovery or matching — that is the OPO and OPTN's job. A donation-awareness nonprofit's real levers are **education, myth-correction, trust-building, and driving registry sign-ups** (especially in under-registered communities). Keep that scope in mind throughout.

A note on vocabulary: the field's preferred phrase is "organ, eye, and tissue donation" (eyes/corneas are tracked separately from other tissue). Say "deceased donor," not "cadaveric"; say "recover/recovery," not "harvest." "Donor" registration normally means *deceased* donation; living donation is arranged separately.

## 1. The US donation & transplant system and its oversight

The US system is a public-private structure created by the **National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) of 1984**, which banned the sale of organs and established the national network.

- **HRSA (Health Resources & Services Administration)** — the HHS agency that **oversees the OPTN** via federal contract and runs the public-facing education site **organdonor.gov** (organdonor.gov; HRSA). HRSA sets the rules of the road; it does not itself match organs.
- **OPTN (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network)** — the national transplant system mandated by NOTA. The OPTN sets allocation **policy**, operates the matching technology, and collects the data. Membership includes transplant hospitals, OPOs, and labs (optn.transplant.hrsa.gov).
- **UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing)** — a private nonprofit that **held the sole OPTN contract from 1986 until 2023-2024**. UNOS built and ran the matching system (UNet) and supported OPTN policy work. As of 2024-2025 UNOS is one contractor among others (see Modernization below) (UNOS.org).
- **SRTR (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients)** — the analytics arm that publishes program- and OPO-level outcome statistics used in policy and public reporting.

### The 2023-2024 OPTN Modernization Initiative (important and ongoing)

After 2022 Senate Finance Committee scrutiny and reports of system failures, HRSA launched the **OPTN Modernization Initiative in March 2023** to break UNOS's monopoly and introduce competition.

- Congress passed the **Securing the U.S. OPTN Act (Public Law 118-14, signed Sept. 2023)**, which removed the statutory language that had effectively limited the OPTN to a single contractor and let HRSA award **multiple contracts** for separate functions — IT, operations, board support, etc. (HRSA OPTN Modernization; The Regulatory Review, 2024-06-04).
- **UNOS's long-standing sole contract ended March 29, 2024.** UNOS signed a **short-term contract effective March 30, 2024** (a base period plus option extensions) and has continued in a reduced role under extensions (UNOS, "UNOS and HRSA agree on new short-term OPTN contract").
- **Board independence:** In 2024 the OPTN **Board of Directors was separated from UNOS** to remove the conflict of interest where the contractor also governed the network; an independent OPTN board structure is being stood up (HRSA; OPTN public comment on OPTN/contractor board relationship).
- **Functions being competed out:** HRSA is splitting OPTN functions across vendors. Patient-safety and committee-support functions were slated to **leave the UNOS contract and be competed in early 2026**, per the multi-vendor plan (HRSA OPTN Modernization updates, Nov. 2025). Expect continued churn in *who* runs *what* through 2026 — verify current contractor assignments before stating them.

Takeaway for a venture: the *registration and education* layer (DMV, Donate Life, organdonor.gov) is stable; the *governance/contractor* layer is mid-restructuring. Don't pin messaging to "UNOS runs the system" — say "the OPTN, overseen by HRSA."

## 2. Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) and CMS performance rules

**OPOs** are the nonprofits that do the on-the-ground work of deceased donation: responding to hospital referrals, evaluating potential donors, obtaining authorization, coordinating recovery, and getting organs to transplant centers. There are roughly **55 federally designated OPOs**, each assigned an exclusive geographic **Donation Service Area (DSA)** (organdonor.gov; HonorBridge). Hospitals are required by federal law to refer all imminent deaths to their OPO.

OPOs are reimbursed through Medicare and regulated by **CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)** under "Conditions for Coverage."

### The 2020 CMS OPO Final Rule (the accountability shake-up)

On **November 20, 2020**, CMS finalized a rule (effective for the cohort starting 2022, with consequences landing in **2026**) that replaced self-reported OPO metrics with **objective, claims-based outcome measures** — a **donation rate** and a **transplantation rate**, benchmarked against all OPOs (CMS Fact Sheet, 2020-11-20). It created a **three-tier system** with non-overlapping performance bands (an OPO's tier is set by its worse of the two rates relative to the national distribution):

| Tier | Performance band | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | At or above the **75th percentile** (top performers) | Automatically recertified |
| Tier 2 | **Below the 75th percentile but at or above the median** | Must **compete** to keep the DSA |
| Tier 3 | **Below the median** | **Decertified** (the DSA is reassigned) |

Analysts have warned that a large share of OPOs (estimates around **42%**) could face decertification/competition in the **2026** recertification cycle — a real risk of disruption that the industry (AOPO) has pushed back on (AOPO; Applied Policy; Crowell & Moring). In **January 2026** CMS issued a **proposed rule** offering additional guidance — e.g., an OPO assigned at least one Tier 1 or Tier 2 DSA would not be treated as out of compliance with Conditions of Participation on outcomes alone (Holland & Knight, 2026-03; Crowell & Moring). **[UNVERIFIED — status as of mid-2026 is in flux; verify the final rule and 2026 cycle outcomes before publishing.]**

Why it matters for NC: NC's OPOs operate under this regime, and there has been active **DSA "turf" conflict** in NC (see §9). A venture should understand that OPO performance and territory are contested and politically live.

## 3. Donor registration pathways

Registering is a declaration of intent to be a **deceased** organ, eye, and tissue donor. In the US it is **opt-in** and, for adults, **first-person authorization** (legally binding — see §7). Main pathways:

- **State donor registries** — every state has one. This is the authoritative legal record an OPO checks at time of death.
- **DMV / motor-vehicle sign-up** — the dominant channel. When you get or renew a license/ID, you're asked to join; saying yes adds a **heart symbol** to the card and enters you in the state registry. DMV and driver-license partners have helped roughly **165 million** people register through that channel — a subset of the **~170 million total registered donors** across all channels (Donate Life America).
- **Donate Life America (DLA)** — the national nonprofit coalition that brands "Donate Life," runs **National Donate Life Month (April)**, and operates the **National Donate Life Registry at RegisterMe.org**, launched **2015** (donatelife.net).
- **National Donate Life Registry** — a national, mobile-friendly registry that syncs registrations and is accessible to OPOs nationwide. Also reachable via the **Apple Health app** (iPhone) and, increasingly, **MyChart/Epic** patient portals — DLA reported in **December 2025** that **130,000+** people registered via MyChart, and that nearly half of recent new registrations came through MyChart (Donate Life America, 2025).
- **organdonor.gov** — HRSA's hub that routes people to their state/registry sign-up and hosts educational content.

For a venture, the practical message is: "Sign up at the DMV, online at your state registry or RegisterMe.org, or in your phone's Health app — it's free and you can specify your wishes." Online registration often lets people **specify or exclude** organs/tissues; the DMV heart is broader but simpler.

---

## 4. Living vs deceased donation

**Deceased donation** is the large majority of transplants and the focus of "donor registration." A single deceased donor can **save up to 8 lives** (organs) and **enhance up to ~75 more** through tissue/eye donation (organdonor.gov). Roughly **30,000** tissue donors contribute each year; corneal transplant success rates exceed 95% (organdonor.gov).

**Living donation** — a healthy person donates a kidney or a portion of liver (and rarely lung lobe or other tissue) while alive. In **2024, about 7,030 living donors** made roughly **7,000 living-donor transplants — about 15% of the year's 48,149 total** (about **6,400 living-donor kidneys and ~600 living-donor livers**) (OPTN/UNOS 2024 data; Donate Life America). (Some sources cite ~18% against a smaller transplant base; the figure here is computed against the 48,149 topline used throughout this skill.) Types:

- **Directed** — to a specific known recipient (most living donations).
- **Non-directed / altruistic ("Good Samaritan")** — to a stranger; a small minority of living donors (OPTN/UNOS 2024 data).
- **Paired exchange / kidney paired donation (KPD)** — when a willing donor isn't a match for their intended recipient, pairs (or chains) are swapped so each recipient gets a compatible kidney. The **National Kidney Registry** organizes most large US swaps (National Kidney Registry; Donate Life America). DLA in 2025 launched a **two-year national pilot to support living kidney donation** via a Living Donor Pathway (donatelife.net, 2025).

Living donation is arranged through transplant centers, not the deceased-donor registry — a useful distinction when a campaign gets "how do I donate a kidney to my relative?" questions.

---

## 5. DBD vs DCD (donation after brain vs circulatory death)

Two legal pathways for declaring death in deceased donation:

- **DBD — Donation after Brain Death:** the donor is declared dead by **neurological criteria** (irreversible cessation of all brain function) while the heart still beats on support. Historically the larger pathway; organs are recovered with circulation maintained until recovery.
- **DCD — Donation after Circulatory Death:** the donor has a non-survivable injury but does **not** meet brain-death criteria; after a planned withdrawal of life support and **irreversible cessation of circulation**, death is declared and organs are recovered. Both are governed by the **dead-donor rule** (recovery does not cause death).

**DCD has grown rapidly.** In **2024 there were ~7,280 DCD donors, up ~23.5% over 2023** (OPTN/UNOS; The Organ Donation Alliance). Two enabling technologies drove this:

- **Normothermic Regional Perfusion (NRP)** — restoring oxygenated blood flow *in situ* to target organs after circulatory-death declaration, improving organ viability (used increasingly since ~2019).
- **Ex-vivo normothermic machine perfusion** — keeping organs functioning outside the body; FDA-relevant approval for livers around **2021** and enabling **DCD heart** transplantation from ~2019 (peer-reviewed cardiac/liver/lung series, PMC, 2024-2025).

Studies through 2024-2025 generally show **NRP-assisted DCD outcomes comparable to DBD** for heart, liver, and lung (PMC/PubMed, 2024-2025). NRP is also **ethically debated** (concerns about restoring circulation after death declaration) — worth knowing if a campaign touches the "how death is determined" myth space (see §8).

---

## 6. The waitlist, allocation, and continuous distribution

**The waitlist:** Over **100,000 people** are on the US transplant waiting list (the field commonly cites "~103,000+"; ~85-90% are waiting for kidneys). Someone is added roughly **every 8-10 minutes**, and on the order of **~13-17 people die each day** waiting (figures vary by source and year — pull current numbers from the OPTN dashboard, organdonor.gov). In **2024 the US performed a record 48,149 transplants** (+3.3% over 2023), enabled by **16,988 deceased donors** and **7,030 living donors** (OPTN/UNOS, Jan. 2025).

**Allocation basics:** organs are matched to candidates by medical and logistical factors — blood/tissue type, organ size, medical urgency, time on the list, geographic/logistical proximity, and pediatric status. There is **no payment and no preference by race, gender, income, or celebrity**; the matching is run by the OPTN system. Geography historically used fixed DSA/region boundaries.

**Continuous Distribution** — the OPTN's current modernization of *how organs are allocated*. It **replaces hard geographic boundaries and rigid tiers with a single weighted "composite allocation score,"** combining attributes (medical urgency, candidate biology, expected benefit, access/equity, proximity/efficiency) into points so no single factor is an absolute cutoff (HRSA: Continuous Distribution; optn.transplant.hrsa.gov). Rollout is organ-by-organ:

- **Lung** — continuous distribution went live **March 9, 2023** (first organ).
- **Kidney/Pancreas, Heart, Liver/Intestine** — in development/phased through 2024-2026; heart and liver/intestine proposals and public comments were active in 2025. A comprehensive **multi-organ allocation policy** was out for public comment in 2025 (HRSA public comment pages, 2025).

For a venture: continuous distribution is the headline allocation reform; "lung is done, the rest are rolling out" is the accurate one-liner. Verify which organs have gone live before stating specifics.

---

## 7. Consent models & the opt-in vs opt-out debate

**The US model is opt-in with first-person authorization.** Under the **Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (RUAGA, 2006)** adopted in most states (including NC), a competent adult's registered "yes" is a **legally binding gift that only the donor can revoke** (Donor Alliance; PMC). In practice this means that when a registered adult dies and becomes medically eligible, the law treats the family as **informed, not asked** — the donor already gave consent. (OPOs still work closely and compassionately with families; honoring first-person authorization over family objection is legally supported but handled sensitively.) If a person never registered, the OPO seeks **authorization from the next of kin / legally authorized representative**.

**Opt-out / "presumed consent":** the alternative model (used in e.g. the UK, Spain, and much of Europe) where everyone is **presumed** a donor unless they register a refusal. Spain's high donation rate is often cited *for* opt-out — but Spain's success is widely attributed to its **OPO infrastructure and in-hospital coordinators** ("the Spanish Model"), not the legal default alone.

**The evidence and US debate:** systematic comparisons find that **switching the legal default, by itself, has little reliable effect** on actual donation/transplant numbers; system investment (OPO performance, hospital coordination, family approach) matters more (PMC review, "Opt-In vs Opt-Out"; The Organ Donation & Transplantation Alliance). Analysts generally conclude that moving the US to opt-out **would not by itself make more organs available**, and could even **erode public trust** if perceived as coercive. The US has therefore pursued **better systems and registration** rather than presumed consent. A myth to preempt: claims that "the government will take your organs without consent" — false; US donation is opt-in and consent-based.

---

## 8. Myths, barriers & faith/cultural considerations

A donation-awareness venture lives or dies on **myth-correction and trust**, especially in communities with lower registration. Common myths and the factual responses:

- **"If I'm a registered donor, ER doctors won't try as hard to save me."** False. The medical team treating you is **separate** from the donation/transplant team, and donation is only considered after death is declared and all life-saving efforts have failed (Mayo Clinic; organdonor.gov).
- **"I'm too old / too sick to donate."** Mostly false. There is **no strict age cutoff**; medical suitability is assessed at the time of death. Most conditions don't automatically rule you out.
- **"My religion prohibits it."** Almost always false. **Most major religions support or permit donation** as an act of charity — Catholicism, most Protestant denominations, most branches of Judaism, and Islam generally permit it; positions are often simply *unknown*, which lets myths fill the gap (PMC; organdonor.gov). Clergy engagement is an evidence-supported intervention.
- **"An open-casket funeral won't be possible."** False. Recovery is done surgically and respectfully; open-casket services remain possible.
- **"It costs the family money"** / **"the rich can buy their way up the list."** False on both. The donor's family is **not charged** for donation, and **selling organs is illegal** under NOTA; allocation ignores wealth and status.

**Equity and structural barriers (central to NC and US work):**

- **Racial disparity:** Black/African Americans are roughly **27-30% of the waiting list but only ~13-14% of donors** (HHS Office of Minority Health, 2025; organdonor.gov). Because organ/tissue matching (especially kidney) is more likely within similar genetic backgrounds, **under-registration in a community lengthens waits for that community.**
- **Distrust of the medical system** — rooted in real historical harms (e.g., the Tuskegee study) — is repeatedly identified as a leading barrier among African Americans, alongside lack of awareness and religious misperception (PMC, multiple studies). Trust-building, community/clergy partnership, and culturally grounded messaging are the evidence-based responses, not blame or guilt framing.
- **Cultural/linguistic access** — materials and outreach in-language and via trusted community institutions outperform generic campaigns.

Messaging guidance for a venture: **lead with agency, accuracy, and altruism**, name and correct the specific myth, partner with trusted messengers (faith leaders, community orgs, patient/recipient voices), and avoid fear or coercion framing (which can backfire and feed the opt-out distrust narrative).

## 9. North Carolina law & registry

### The NC Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act

NC adopted the **Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act**, codified at **NC General Statutes Chapter 130A, Article 16 (GS 130A-412.3 et seq.)** (ncleg.gov). Key provisions a venture should know:

- **Who & how to make a gift (GS 130A-412.7, "Manner of making an anatomical gift before death"):** a donor may make a gift by (a) authorizing a **statement/symbol on the driver's license or ID**, (b) a **signed donor card or other signed record**, (c) inclusion in a **donor registry**, (d) a **will**, or (e) **during terminal illness/injury, by communication to at least two adults, one a disinterested witness** (ncleg.gov, GS 130A-412.7). The statute has been amended several times — **2007-538, 2019-143, 2021-32, and 2025-60** — so cite the current version.
- **DMV-method limitation:** a gift made *only* via the **license/ID symbol does not by itself include the donor's body** (i.e., the heart on the card covers organ/eye/tissue, not whole-body/anatomical-board donation) (GS 130A-412.7).
- **Income-tax election (new):** an amendment adds the ability to make an anatomical gift by **election on a NC state income tax return (per GS 105-153.8A), effective January 1, 2027** (ncleg.gov). **[UNVERIFIED — effective date and mechanics; verify against the enacted text before relying on it.]**
- **First-person authorization is binding:** consistent with RUAGA, an adult NC registrant's gift is legally binding and revocable only by the donor; hospitals' obligations and family interactions follow Article 16.
- **Hospital referral duty:** NC law requires hospitals to **notify the appropriate organ, eye, and tissue recovery agency** when a person dies or death is imminent (NC Secretary of State; Article 16). This is how OPOs learn of potential donors.

### NC donor registry mechanics

- **The registry:** the **NC Division of Motor Vehicles (NC DMV) is partnered with Donate Life NC** to maintain **"the only online database of registered organ donors"** in NC (NC Secretary of State). **Donate Life NC (donatelifenc.org)** is the state's donation-education affiliate and the public face of the registry.
- **Three ways to register in NC:** (1) **at the DMV** when getting/renewing a license or ID; (2) **online** at donatelifenc.org (you'll need your NC driver's license/ID number); (3) **in the Apple Health app** on iPhone (Donate Life NC).
- **DMV must ask:** by NC law the **DMV is required to ask all drivers age 16 and older** whether they want to join the registry; saying yes adds a **red heart** to the license/ID (Donate Life NC).
- **Minors vs adults:** a person **16-17 can have the heart**, but **parents retain the right to make the final decision**; at **18 the heart becomes legally binding first-person consent** (Donate Life NC).
- **Online lets you specify wishes:** registering online (vs the DMV heart) lets you **choose or exclude** specific organs/tissues (Donate Life NC).
- **Advance directive nuance:** filing a **Declaration of an Anatomical Gift** in the NC Secretary of State's **Advance Health Care Directive Registry** is **not** accessible to the DMV or Donate Life NC registry — the SOSNC advises **also** registering with Donate Life NC or the DMV so recovery agencies can find your wishes (NC Secretary of State).

### NC's OPOs (two serve the state — important)

NC is split between **two federally designated OPOs** by territory:

| OPO | Territory (NC) | Population / hospitals | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **HonorBridge** (formerly **Carolina Donor Services**, rebranded Aug. 2021) | **77 NC counties** + Pittsylvania County, VA | ~7.5M; 100+ hospitals, 200+ transplant centers | NC's largest OPO; HQ Greenville, NC (offices Winston-Salem, Chapel Hill/Durham); registration portal honorbridge.org/registerme (honorbridge.org) |
| **LifeShare Carolinas** (LifeShare of the Carolinas) | **~22-23 counties** in western/southwestern NC (incl. Charlotte, Asheville) | ~3.1M; ~40 hospitals | Affiliated with **Atrium Health**; founded 1970 (lifesharecarolinas.org; Donate Life NC) |

- **DSA conflict:** the two OPOs and CMS have been in active **territory disputes** (e.g., litigation over the **Winston-Salem / Lexington Medical Center** area in 2025-2026, tied to the CMS rule), so service-area boundaries can shift — verify current DSA assignments (HonorBridge press release, 2025; NC Health News, 2025-03; Federal Register, 2026-02).

NC also has a **whole-body/anatomical donation** path (for medical education/research) handled separately via medical schools / a state anatomical program — distinct from the organ/eye/tissue registry above. **[UNVERIFIED — NC anatomical-board specifics not deeply verified here; confirm before advising donors on whole-body donation.]**

---

## 10. Data sources (pull current numbers from these)

Statistics change yearly; **always cite the as-of date** and prefer these primary sources over secondhand blogs:

- **OPTN national data** — optn.transplant.hrsa.gov (waitlist, donors, transplants; the authoritative US numbers).
- **HRSA Organ Donation & Transplantation Dashboard** — data.hrsa.gov (national/state trends, OPO-level data).
- **organdonor.gov** — HRSA's education hub and statistics summary (note: this site and hrsa.gov may block automated fetching; open in a browser).
- **SRTR** — srtr.org (program- and OPO-level outcomes).
- **UNOS** — unos.org (newsroom, annual totals, modernization updates).
- **Donate Life America** — donatelife.net (registry data, National Donate Life Month statistics PDF, living-donation pilots).
- **CMS** — cms.gov (OPO Conditions for Coverage final/proposed rules, performance reporting).
- **NC:** **ncleg.gov** (GS Ch. 130A Art. 16 statute text), **donatelifenc.org** (NC registry/FAQ), **NC Secretary of State** sosnc.gov (advance directive registry, DMV relationship), **honorbridge.org** and **lifesharecarolinas.org** (NC OPOs).

Confirmed reference figures used above (verify before republishing): **48,149** US transplants in 2024 (+3.3%); **16,988** deceased + **7,030** living donors (2024); **~7,280** DCD donors (2024, +23.5%); **~103,000+** on the waitlist; **~170 million** registered US donors; **~55** OPOs; **1 donor → up to 8 lives + ~75 enhanced**.

## Disclaimer

This is **general educational information**, not medical or legal advice. It is intended to ground a donation-awareness venture's understanding of the US and North Carolina donation systems — it does not establish a donor's legal status, advise on a specific medical situation, or substitute for counsel on nonprofit, healthcare, or consent law. **Donation policy, federal contracts/contractors, CMS rules, allocation policy, statistics, and NC statutes all change** — several items here are mid-transition as of mid-2026 (OPTN modernization/contractors, the 2026 CMS OPO recertification cycle, continuous-distribution rollout by organ, the NC 2025-60 amendment and the 2027 tax-return method, and NC OPO service-area disputes). **Always verify current details against primary sources** — HRSA/OPTN (optn.transplant.hrsa.gov, hrsa.gov), organdonor.gov, CMS, the NC General Statutes (ncleg.gov), Donate Life NC, and the relevant NC OPO — before publishing claims, especially statutes, statistics, and citations. Items marked **[UNVERIFIED]** or with verification caveats above were not fully confirmed against a primary source in this draft.
