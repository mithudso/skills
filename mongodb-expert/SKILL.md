# MongoDB Expert

This local skill is generated from `docs/mongodb-expert-context.md` in `10gen/mdb-tam`.

This skill consolidates 27 MongoDB data-plane/engine sub-skills as on-demand reference files under `references/`. It is the **primary, first-choice skill** for core MongoDB questions — not a fallback. Match the task to the **Sub-skill routing table** below and **Read the listed `references/…md` file before answering deep questions** — the table alone is not enough for depth. Route to a sibling hub (`mongodb-atlas-expert`, `atlas-diagnostics-expert`, `mongodb-operations-expert`, `misc-catch-all`) only when the question falls into one of those domains (see frontmatter `SKIP`).

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user needs help with core MongoDB data-plane or database-engine topics. Start from the bundled context below for fundamentals, load the relevant `references/` file for depth, and defer to the cited official documentation for exact APIs, commands, and edge-case behavior.

## Sub-skill routing table

This hub absorbs 27 former standalone skills as on-demand reference files. When a task matches a row, **Read the listed `references/` file** before answering — do not rely on this table alone for depth. For domains not listed here (Atlas cloud platform, live diagnostics, ops/backup/migration/security, KB lookup), route to the sibling hub named in the frontmatter `SKIP` line.

## Cross-hub routing (domains this hub does NOT own)

The **Sub-skill routing table** above is the authoritative map of the reference files this hub owns (27 routed sub-topics plus `mongodb-mql-quick-reference.md` and `mongodb-expert-context.md`) — route data-plane/engine depth through `references/<name>.md`. Most former standalone spokes exist only as these reference files; a few are hot-tiered and also installed top-level (`deep-mongodb-mql-query-optimizer`, `mongodb-docset-lookup`) — for those, prefer the live top-level skill when the task needs its full workflow (e.g. the dmqo fix-loop), and the reference file for background depth.

For domains outside this hub, route to the **sibling hub** that owns them. Each sibling hub has its own internal routing table for its sub-areas — do not name individual sub-skills here:

| Domain area | Route to sibling hub |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Atlas cloud platform / control plane — orgs, projects, deployments, Admin API, Atlas CLI, Terraform, Kubernetes Operator (AKO), tiers, IAM/RBAC, federated auth, service accounts, Atlas Search / $search, Vector Search / $vectorSearch, Search Nodes, Stream Processing, Charts, Data Federation, Online Archive, App Services, Triggers/Functions, Device SDK / Realm sync, BI Connector, analytics nodes, global clusters, Flex/Serverless, multicloud + AWS/Azure/GCP networking | `mongodb-atlas-expert` |
| Live cluster diagnostics, performance troubleshooting, benchmarking, monitoring/observability, capacity planning | `atlas-diagnostics-expert` |
| Backup/restore, disaster recovery, Ops Manager, migration (mongosync, Relational Migrator, Live Migration, cutover), upgrade paths, security architecture, encryption (CSFLE/Queryable Encryption), compliance, cost optimization, Kafka/Spark connectors, CDC architecture | `mongodb-operations-expert` |
| KB / troubleshooting article lookup; install/run MongoDB locally from a repo | `misc-catch-all` |
| Generic schema/data-migration patterns (expand-contract, backfill, zero-downtime) | `database-migrations` |
| GridFS large-file storage spec (chunk/bucket model, 16 MB limit, fs.files/fs.chunks) | `mongodb-gridfs` |
| ODM / application-data-modeling layer — Mongoose, Spring Data MongoDB, Beanie, ODMantic, Prisma MongoDB connector, ODM-vs-raw-driver decision | `mongodb-odm-patterns` |
| Clustered collections — `clusteredIndex` on `_id`, single-file storage, TTL on `_id`, IoT/log workloads keyed on `_id` | `mongodb-clustered-collections` |
| Case-/accent-insensitive or locale-aware comparison, sort, collation-strength index design | `mongodb-collation` |
| MongoDB as an analytics data source — lakehouse/warehouse loading, data-engineering pipelines | `da-data-engineering-platform` |
| Security architecture review, GDPR/CCPA compliance posture, Okta↔MongoDB auth integration | `security-review` |
| MongoDB University courses, learning paths, certification program | `technical-instruction` |
| Natural-language query generation or one-shot "optimize this query / recommend an index" against a live connected cluster (MCP) | `mongodb:mongodb-natural-language-querying` / `mongodb:mongodb-query-optimizer` |

When a question crosses categories, pick the deepest reference that covers the primary concern, load it, then cross-link to the relevant sibling hub for the secondary concern.

## Skill guidance

- Treat `docs/mongodb-expert-context.md` as the source document for this skill.
- Prefer the workflows, checklists, and constraints captured in the bundled context before improvising.
- If the request is outside this topic, choose a more appropriate skill instead of forcing this one.
- For deep data-plane/engine questions, **Read the matching `references/<name>.md` file** from the Sub-skill routing table rather than improvising from this overview. For out-of-domain questions, route to the sibling hub named in the cross-hub routing table above.
- If no routing-table row matches but the question is still core data-plane/engine (e.g. capped collections, read/write concerns, causal consistency, `$jsonSchema` validation, rollback), answer from `references/mongodb-expert-context.md` plus the Manual links it cites — do not force a sibling-hub handoff.

## Bundled context

The full MongoDB fundamentals context — quick rules, core document/MQL model, CRUD and write-atomicity semantics, transactions, data-modeling and embed-vs-reference guidance, index and aggregation principles, driver-vs-mongosh guidance, and version-sensitivity notes — lives in `references/mongodb-expert-context.md` (**Read it** when a question needs grounding in fundamentals rather than one sub-skill's depth; it is also the no-match fallback target named in Skill guidance). Source: `docs/mongodb-expert-context.md` in the mdb-tam repository.

<!-- cross-hub-map -->
## Cross-hub map — where every MongoDB topic lives

All MongoDB knowledge is split across **four hubs** (plus `misc-catch-all` for KB-article
lookups and repo install/run, and `mongodb-docset-lookup` for offline Manual page lookup from the
local Dash docset). If a task's deep material is **not** in this hub's Sub-skill routing
table, it is either a reference file under a sibling hub — **activate that hub or Read its
`references/<name>.md` directly** — or a standalone top-level skill for a narrower topic
(`mongodb-gridfs`, `mongodb-odm-patterns`); see the frontmatter `whenNotToUse` for those cases.

| Hub | Owns | Example reference files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mongodb-expert` | Core data plane + **engine internals**: CRUD/MQL, aggregation, indexes, query performance, schema design, transactions, change streams, time-series, geospatial, views, BSON, error codes, connection strings, driver internals, **WiredTiger cache/eviction/checkpoint internals**, mongosh, database tools, multi-tenancy, sharding, replication, Compass | `references/mongodb-wiredtiger-internals.md`, `mongodb-indexes-deep.md`, `mongodb-sharding.md`, `mongodb-replication.md` |
| `mongodb-atlas-expert` | Atlas **cloud platform**: control plane, Atlas Search, Vector Search, Stream Processing, Charts, Data Federation, App Services, Triggers, Online Archive, Flex, networking, IAM/RBAC, Terraform, AKO | `references/mongodb-atlas-search.md`, `mongodb-atlas-vector-search.md` |
| `atlas-diagnostics-expert` | Live **diagnostics & performance**: ts-diag, FTDC, performance-troubleshooting symptom triage, benchmarking, monitoring/observability, capacity planning | `references/mongodb-performance-troubleshooting.md` |
| `mongodb-operations-expert` | **Ops & data movement**: backup/restore, DR, Ops Manager, upgrades, migration, mongosync, relational migrator, CDC, data lifecycle, security architecture, encryption, compliance, cost, Kafka/Spark connectors | `references/mongosync.md`, `mongodb-backup-restore.md` |

**High-overlap routing notes:**
- Performance **symptom triage** (high CPU, cache pressure, slow queries, latency spikes) starts at `atlas-diagnostics-expert`, but **storage-engine root-cause internals** (WiredTiger cache fill / dirty trigger / eviction threads / reconciliation / checkpoints) are owned by `mongodb-expert` — cross-load `mongodb-expert/references/mongodb-wiredtiger-internals.md` (and `mongodb-wiredtiger.md`) for depth.
- Migration symptoms vs migration **execution**: live-cluster diagnosis → `atlas-diagnostics-expert`; the migration/mongosync runbook → `mongodb-operations-expert`.
- Atlas Search/Vector **query syntax & index design** → `mongodb-atlas-expert`; the slowness *triage* of a running search → `atlas-diagnostics-expert`.
