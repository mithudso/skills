# Data FinOps and Cost Optimization

## Overview

Data FinOps applies the FinOps Foundation's operating model — **Inform → Optimize → Operate** — to consumption-based data and analytics platforms. The defining difference from infrastructure FinOps: traditional cloud bills for *provisioned* resources over time, while data cloud platforms bill for *activity* — queries executed, bytes scanned, and consumption of virtual units (Snowflake **credits**, BigQuery **slots**, Databricks **DBUs**). Cost therefore lives in *workload telemetry* (queries, jobs, pipelines, platform metadata), not in a server inventory.

The 2025 FinOps Framework formalized **Scopes** and a dedicated **"FinOps for Data Cloud Platforms"** technology category covering Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Redshift, and Microsoft Fabric ([finops.org/framework/scope](https://www.finops.org/framework/scope/finops-for-data-cloud-platforms/), 2025; [2025 Framework](https://www.finops.org/insights/2025-finops-framework/)). The discipline pairs data engineers, data scientists, product, and finance to connect spend to value.

Scope note: this skill covers analytics/warehouse FinOps. For **MongoDB / Atlas** cost and sizing, defer to `mongodb-cost-optimization`.

## Core Concepts

### The three FinOps phases applied to data
- **Inform** — ingest billing exports + query history + metadata; allocate shared/transient compute; report, forecast, and build unit economics.
- **Optimize** — query tuning, storage lifecycle, workload placement, rate optimization (commitments), right-sizing.
- **Operate** — make cost-awareness a daily habit: tagging policy, governance, budgets, anomaly alerts, chargeback. ([FinOps phases](https://www.finops.org/framework/phases/), 2025; [State of FinOps 2025](https://data.finops.org/2025-report/))

### Cloud data warehouse cost models (know the unit before optimizing)

**Snowflake — credits / virtual warehouses.** Compute bills per-second of active warehouse runtime with a **60-second minimum on every start**. Each warehouse size step (XS→S→M→L…) **doubles credits/hour**. On-demand credits run ~$2–4 each; commitments ~$1.50–2.50. Storage and serverless features (clustering, MVs) bill separately. ([Snowflake cost controls](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-controlling-controls), 2025; [SELECT pricing](https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-pricing), 2025; [Revefi 2026 guide](https://www.revefi.com/blog/snowflake-cost-optimization))

**BigQuery — on-demand vs Editions/slots.**
- *On-demand:* **$6.25/TB scanned** (first 1 TB/mo free per project). Billed on *columns selected*, not rows returned — `LIMIT` does **not** cut cost; fewer columns + partition/cluster pruning do.
- *Editions (capacity):* pay-as-you-go slot-hours — Standard ~$0.04, Enterprise ~$0.06, Enterprise Plus ~$0.10. 1-yr commit ~25–30% lower, 3-yr ~40% lower.
- *Crossover:* sustained >~100 slots usually favors capacity over on-demand. Autoscaling bills **slots allocated, not used**, scales in steps of 100 with a 1-minute floor — a 10s query still costs a full minute. ([BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing), 2025; [Editions intro](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/editions-intro), 2025; [Revefi slot guide](https://www.revefi.com/blog/bigquery-slot-cost-explained), 2025)

**Databricks — DBUs.** Bill = **DBU rate × node count × runtime hours × cloud VM list price** (the VM is separate, except serverless which bundles it). DBU rate is fixed per **SKU**; the SKU choice dominates cost:
- *All-Purpose Compute* — highest rate (~$0.55/DBU Premium).
- *Jobs Compute* — 40–60% cheaper than All-Purpose; **migrating scheduled work here is the single highest-return change.**
- *SQL Warehouses* — SQL Classic (~$0.22/DBU) cheapest, SQL Pro (~$0.55), Serverless SQL (~$0.70–0.91, infra bundled).
- *Photon* — vectorized C++ engine; faster but **raises the DBU rate** — a 3× faster query may cost ~1.5× DBUs/hr, so validate net savings.
- Standard tier sunset on AWS/GCP Oct 2025, Azure by Oct 2026. ([CloudZero](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/databricks-pricing/), 2026; [Flexera guide](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/databricks-pricing-guide/), 2026; [Revefi guide](https://www.revefi.com/blog/databricks-pricing-guide), 2026)

### Query cost attribution & chargeback/showback
- **Showback** = show teams their consumption without billing them (central budget absorbs cost). **Chargeback** = bill teams directly via internal transfer. Showback first builds trust; chargeback drives accountability. ([Revefi showback vs chargeback](https://www.revefi.com/blog/chargeback-vs-showback-for-snowflake-databricks-and-bigquery), 2025)
- **Snowflake:** `QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` gives per-query compute cost; `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` gives warehouse credit usage; **query tags** associate queries to teams/projects. ([Snowflake attributing cost](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-attributing), 2025)
- **Databricks:** `system.billing.usage` (Unity Catalog) + the `custom_tags` field on each record; tag clusters/jobs via Terraform. ([Databricks attribution queries](https://community.databricks.com/t5/technical-blog/queries-for-cost-attribution-using-system-tables/ba-p/76558), 2025)
- **FOCUS 1.3** (ratified Dec 2025) added shared-cost allocation, commitment datasets, and recency signals — the first spec making **cross-provider** warehouse FinOps tractable. ([DataLakehouseHub FinOps](https://datalakehousehub.com/blog/2026-05-finops-warehouse-cost/), 2026)

### Unit economics
Move past raw warehouse cost to value-linked metrics: **cost per query, per pipeline, per dashboard, per model run, per TB processed/stored**; plus **storage decay / dark-data ratio** and **commitment-utilization score**. These connect billing exports to unit consumption (credits/DBUs/slots) so leaders can decide what to scale, tune, or retire. ([FinOps value insight](https://www.finops.org/insights/finops-for-data-cloud-platforms/), 2025; [Revefi KPIs](https://www.revefi.com/blog/kpis-finops-leaders-must-know), 2025; [Vantage unit economics](https://www.vantage.sh/blog/automate-unit-economics), 2025)

## Methodology (Inform → Optimize → Operate)

1. **Identify the billing unit** for each platform (credits / slots / DBUs) and where it accrues. You cannot optimize what you cannot price.
2. **Inform — establish visibility.** Ingest billing exports + query history (`QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY`, `system.billing.usage`, BQ `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`). Build a cost dashboard and a baseline.
3. **Allocate & attribute.** Enforce tags at the *framework* level — in dbt profiles, Airflow operators, and query runners — not by asking analysts to remember. Decide showback vs chargeback.
4. **Define unit economics.** Pick 2–3 metrics (cost/query, cost/dashboard, cost/pipeline) that map to business value; track them over time.
5. **Optimize — usage.** Right-size warehouses; tune auto-suspend; add partition/cluster pruning + MVs; convert heavy dbt models to incremental; tier/lifecycle storage; move scheduled Databricks jobs to Jobs Compute.
6. **Optimize — rate.** Move sustained workloads to commitments/Editions; validate Photon net savings; consolidate idle warehouses.
7. **Operate — sustain.** Resource monitors / budgets with hard caps; cost-anomaly alerts to Slack; cost in PR review (`state:modified+`); periodic heavy-model and dark-data review.

## Practical Patterns

- **Right-size by parallelism test.** If doubling Snowflake warehouse size halves query time, the workload is parallelizable and the bigger size is *cost-neutral but faster*. If it doesn't, you're overpaying. ([Yuki guide](https://yukidata.com/blog/snowflake-warehouse-optimization-guide/), 2025)
- **Auto-suspend tiers.** ~60s for BI/interactive warehouses, ~30s for programmatic ETL (dbt/Airflow/Tasks). Most workloads tolerate the resume delay. ([Anavsan](https://www.anavsan.com/blog/snowflake-warehouse-optimization-beyond-auto-suspend), 2025)
- **Prune before you scan.** Partition on date; cluster large tables on predictable filter columns; use materialized views for repeated aggregations. Partition pruning is the single biggest cost+perf lever in both Snowflake and BigQuery. ([e6data](https://www.e6data.com/query-and-cost-optimization-hub/snowflake-query-optimization), 2025; [Flexera tuning](https://www.flexera.com/blog/finops/snowflake-query-tuning-part1/), 2026)
- **Incremental dbt models with predicates.** Process only new/changed rows; add `incremental_predicates` to bound the merge scan window. Bilt Rewards cut ~$20K/mo BigQuery; some models dropped 3h→40m. ([dbt reduce BigQuery costs](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/reduce-bigquery-costs), 2025; [TDS incremental](https://towardsdatascience.com/reduce-computing-costs-with-dbt-incremental-models-a2025d42e633/), 2025)
- **dbt + Snowflake cost formula:** `Total Cost = Warehouse Size × Runtime × Run Frequency`. Every optimization reduces one of the three. ([dbt 4 decisions](https://medium.com/@blakelassiter/4-decisions-that-control-90-of-your-dbt-snowflake-costs-299113dc408c), 2025)
- **Storage lifecycle tiering.** Move dormant data to COOL/COLD tiers (Snowflake Storage Lifecycle Policies cut 55–90% for dormant data); use periodic clones instead of long Time Travel windows. ([Snowflake storage lifecycle](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/storage-management/storage-lifecycle-policies), 2025; [analytics.today](https://articles.analytics.today/snowflake-best-practices-time-travel-fail-safe-and-data-retention), 2025)
- **Anomaly alerts to humans.** Snowflake Cost Anomalies (GA Dec 2025) decomposes 28 days into trend + weekly seasonality and flags deviations; route to Slack/email and pair with Resource Monitor hard caps. ([Snowflake cost anomalies GA](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/2025/other/2025-12-02-cost-anomalies-ga), 2025; [Anomaly Insights](https://www.snowflake.com/en/engineering-blog/anomaly-insights-spending-patterns/), 2025)

## Anti-Patterns

- **Optimizing performance without pricing the unit.** A "faster" Photon or larger-warehouse query can cost *more*. Always check net DBUs/credits, not just wall-clock.
- **`LIMIT` to save BigQuery cost.** On-demand bills bytes scanned across selected columns — `LIMIT` changes nothing. Select fewer columns and prune partitions instead.
- **`SELECT *` in models/dashboards.** Forces full-column scans on columnar engines; explode cost at scale.
- **Auto-suspend too long (or off).** Idle warehouses burn credits; a 10-minute auto-suspend on a bursty BI warehouse wastes most of every hour.
- **Tag-when-you-remember.** Manual per-analyst tagging yields unallocatable spend. Enforce tags in dbt/Airflow/runners.
- **90-day Time Travel everywhere.** Long CDP retention silently multiplies storage cost; clone instead.
- **Editions/commitments before measuring.** Buying slots/commitments for spiky, low-volume workloads locks in waste — short, spiky queries usually stay cheaper on-demand.
- **Photon-by-default.** It raises the DBU rate; only worth it when the speedup outpaces the rate increase.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Bill spiked overnight."** Check cost-anomaly view; query `QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` / `system.billing.usage` / BQ `JOBS` for the top consumers by tag in the window; look for a runaway scheduled job, a removed `LIMIT`-less full scan, or auto-suspend regression.
- **"BigQuery cost high but queries look small."** It's bytes *scanned*, not returned — inspect `total_bytes_processed`; add partition/cluster filters; cache or materialize repeated aggregations.
- **"Snowflake warehouse always-on."** Verify `AUTO_SUSPEND` and that no keep-alive query/dashboard polls it; consolidate near-idle warehouses; set a Resource Monitor.
- **"Can't attribute spend to teams."** Tags missing at source — instrument dbt `query-comment`/tags, Airflow operator tags, Databricks Terraform `custom_tags`; backfill via query-text parsing only as a stopgap.
- **"Databricks bill dominated by one SKU."** Audit `system.billing.usage` by SKU; migrate scheduled work off All-Purpose to Jobs Compute (40–60% cheaper).
- **"Storage cost creeping up."** Check Time Travel/Fail-safe retention and dark-data ratio; apply lifecycle tiering; drop or archive stale tables.
