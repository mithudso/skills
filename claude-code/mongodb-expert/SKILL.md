# MongoDB Expert

This local skill is generated from `docs/mongodb-expert-context.md` in `10gen/mdb-tam`.

This skill consolidates 24 MongoDB data-plane/engine sub-skills as on-demand reference files under `references/`. It is the **primary, first-choice skill** for core MongoDB questions — not a fallback. Match the task to the **Sub-skill routing table** below and **Read the listed `references/…md` file before answering deep questions** — the table alone is not enough for depth. Route to a sibling hub (`mongodb-atlas-expert`, `atlas-diagnostics-expert`, `mongodb-operations-expert`, `mongodb-kb`) only when the question falls into one of those domains (see frontmatter `SKIP`).

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user needs help with core MongoDB data-plane or database-engine topics. Start from the bundled context below for fundamentals, load the relevant `references/` file for depth, and defer to the cited official documentation for exact APIs, commands, and edge-case behavior.

## Sub-skill routing table

This hub absorbs 24 former standalone skills as on-demand reference files. When a task matches a row, **Read the listed `references/` file** before answering — do not rely on this table alone for depth.

## Cross-hub routing (domains this hub does NOT own)

The **Sub-skill routing table** above is the authoritative map of the 24 reference files this hub owns — always route data-plane/engine depth through `references/<name>.md`, never to a standalone skill name (those skills no longer exist).

For domains outside this hub, route to the **sibling hub** that owns them. Each sibling hub has its own internal routing table for its sub-areas — do not name individual sub-skills here:

| Domain area | Route to sibling hub |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Atlas cloud platform / control plane — orgs, projects, deployments, Admin API, Atlas CLI, Terraform, Kubernetes Operator (AKO), tiers, IAM/RBAC, federated auth, service accounts, Atlas Search / $search, Vector Search / $vectorSearch, Search Nodes, Stream Processing, Charts, Data Federation, Online Archive, App Services, Triggers/Functions, Device SDK / Realm sync, BI Connector, analytics nodes, global clusters, Flex/Serverless, multicloud + AWS/Azure/GCP networking | `mongodb-atlas-expert` |
| Live cluster diagnostics, performance troubleshooting, benchmarking, monitoring/observability, capacity planning | `atlas-diagnostics-expert` |
| Backup/restore, disaster recovery, Ops Manager, migration (mongosync, Relational Migrator, Live Migration, cutover), upgrade paths, security architecture, encryption (CSFLE/Queryable Encryption), compliance, cost optimization, Kafka/Spark connectors, CDC architecture | `mongodb-operations-expert` |
| KB / troubleshooting article lookup | `mongodb-kb` |
| Install / run MongoDB locally from a repo | `10gen` |
| Generic schema/data-migration patterns (expand-contract, backfill, zero-downtime) | `database-migrations` |

When a question crosses categories, pick the deepest reference that covers the primary concern, load it, then cross-link to the relevant sibling hub for the secondary concern.

## Skill guidance

- Treat `docs/mongodb-expert-context.md` as the source document for this skill.
- Prefer the workflows, checklists, and constraints captured in the bundled context before improvising.
- If the request is outside this topic, choose a more appropriate skill instead of forcing this one.
- For deep data-plane/engine questions, **Read the matching `references/<name>.md` file** from the Sub-skill routing table rather than improvising from this overview. For out-of-domain questions, route to the sibling hub named in the cross-hub routing table above.

# MongoDB expert context

## How to use this context

Use this file as a **practical MongoDB reference** when designing schemas, writing queries, reviewing data-access code, or debugging performance issues. Treat the **MongoDB Manual** and **driver docs** as the primary operational/application references, and use the **MQL, operator, command, and method reference pages** for exact behavior and syntax details ([MongoDB Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/), [MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/), [MQL reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/), [mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/)).

## Source scope

- **Platform overview:** MongoDB docs home and Manual ([MongoDB docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/), [MongoDB Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/)).
- **Application-facing usage:** official MongoDB driver docs ([MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)).
- **Exact language behavior:** MongoDB Query Language reference, CRUD command reference, query predicate operators, update operators, projection operators, aggregation docs, and aggregation operator reference ([MQL reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/), [CRUD commands](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/crud-commands/), [Query operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/), [Update operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/update/), [Projection operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/projection/), [Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/), [Aggregation operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/)).
- **Shell-specific usage:** mongosh method reference ([mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/)).
- **Design and performance guidance:** data modeling, indexes, write atomicity, and transactions docs ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/), [Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/), [Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/), [Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).
- These sources are **MongoDB-specific references and practices**, not a general application architecture style guide. Where they do not prescribe naming, repository structure, or language-specific code style, defer to project-local conventions ([MongoDB Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/), [MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)).

## Quick rules

1. Model data around **access patterns**; data accessed together should generally be stored together ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
2. Prefer **embedding** when it lets you satisfy common reads in a single-document fetch; MongoDB explicitly highlights document structures as a way to avoid unnecessary multi-document transactions ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/), [Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).
3. Remember that write operations are **atomic at the single-document level**, but multi-document operations are not atomic as a whole unless you use transactions ([CRUD](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/), [Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/), [Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).
4. Create indexes for repeatedly queried fields, but remember every index has a **write cost** ([Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)).
5. Prefer **aggregation pipelines** for aggregations; MongoDB calls them the preferred aggregation method ([Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)).
6. Use the **driver** in applications; the MongoDB docs explicitly note that most interactions use an idiomatic driver rather than JavaScript shell methods ([mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/), [MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)).
7. When concurrent updates matter, include the **expected current value in the filter** or use operators like `$inc` to avoid accidental lost updates ([Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/)).
8. Use transactions only when you truly need multi-document atomicity; many use cases can be modeled to avoid them ([Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/), [Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
9. Treat MQL as more than simple find filters: it includes query predicates, projections, updates, expressions, and aggregation stages/operators ([MQL reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/)).
10. Separate **driver usage** from **mongosh usage** in your mental model; shell methods are reference and tooling conveniences, not the main application API surface ([mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/), [MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)).

## Core MongoDB model

### Document model and collections

- MongoDB is a **document-oriented operational database** that stores rich JSON-like documents which map naturally to application objects ([MongoDB docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)).
- The document data model is **flexible**: documents in the same collection do not need identical fields, and a field’s type can differ between documents in the same collection ([MongoDB Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/), [Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
- Collections group documents; insert operations target a single collection and create it if it does not exist ([CRUD](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/)).

### MQL and how to think about it

- MongoDB Query Language (MQL) includes **query predicates, aggregation pipelines, expressions, projections, accumulators, update operators, and CRUD commands** ([MQL reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/)).
- Query predicates are boolean expressions that determine whether a document matches a query ([Query operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/)).
- Aggregation expressions are **stateless** and resolve to a value without mutating their inputs ([Aggregation operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/)).

## CRUD and write semantics

### CRUD basics

- CRUD covers **create, read, update, and delete** of documents ([CRUD](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/)).
- MongoDB provides collection-level methods such as `insertOne()` and `insertMany()` for insert operations ([CRUD](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/)).
- At the command layer, CRUD includes commands such as `find`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `distinct`, `aggregate`, `findAndModify`, `count`, and `bulkWrite` ([CRUD commands](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/crud-commands/)).

### Atomicity and concurrent updates

- All write operations are atomic at the **single-document level**, even if they modify multiple values inside that document ([CRUD](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/), [Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/)).
- A multi-document update operation modifies each individual document atomically, but the operation as a whole is **not** atomic ([Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/)).
- To avoid conflicts in concurrent updates, include the expected current value in the update filter; filtering only by `_id` while setting a value can cause the second update to overwrite the first silently ([Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/)).
- `$inc` is specifically called out as a safer concurrent pattern than naive overwrite-based `$set` in some conflict scenarios ([Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/)).

## Transactions

- Single-document operations are atomic, and MongoDB explicitly notes that embedded documents and arrays often remove the need for multi-document transactions ([Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).
- MongoDB supports transactions across **multiple operations, collections, databases, documents, and shards** when true multi-document atomicity is required ([Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).
- The callback transaction API starts a transaction, executes operations, and commits or ends it on error; it also incorporates retry logic for some errors such as `TransientTransactionError` and `UnknownTransactionCommitResult` ([Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).
- There are version-sensitive transaction caveats, including explicit notes in the docs about changed retry behavior in newer server versions ([Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).

## Data modeling and schema design guidance

### Core design principle

- A core MongoDB modeling principle is that **data accessed together should be stored together** ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
- Structure the model according to actual **application data access patterns** to optimize performance ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).

### Embedding vs referencing

- MongoDB’s examples explicitly favor embedding when related data is commonly returned together in a single query, such as department info embedded in employee records ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
- Referencing or separating collections makes sense when some related data is accessed much less frequently, such as older product reviews stored separately from the hot product-page subset ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
- Because documents can be polymorphic, a single collection can support differently shaped items when that matches the application’s model ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).

## Indexes and performance

- Indexes allow MongoDB to avoid scanning every document in a collection for supported queries ([Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)).
- Without an appropriate index, MongoDB must scan every document to return results ([Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)).
- Indexes improve read/query performance but add negative performance impact to writes because inserts and updates must also maintain indexes ([Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)).
- If your application repeatedly runs queries on the same fields, MongoDB explicitly recommends creating indexes on those fields ([Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)).

## Aggregation

- Aggregation processes multiple documents and returns computed results, including grouping values, analyzing changes over time, and querying the latest form of data ([Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)).
- MongoDB calls **aggregation pipelines** the preferred aggregation method ([Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)).
- A pipeline is made of one or more stages, each of which transforms or filters documents before passing them to the next stage ([Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)).
- Aggregation expressions can be used in stages like `$project`, `$addFields`, and `$group`, in `$expr` predicates, and in projections ([Aggregation operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/)).

## Driver vs mongosh guidance

- Most real application interaction with MongoDB uses an **idiomatic driver**, not JavaScript shell methods ([mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/), [MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)).
- The mongosh method reference is specifically about shell methods and notes that these are functional replacements for legacy shell APIs, not exact replacements in every detail ([mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/)).
- Application code should primarily think in terms of the official driver for its language/runtime, while keeping the shell reference available for exploration, debugging, and administrative workflows ([MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/), [mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/)).

## Methods, operators, and APIs inventory

## Coding standards and best practices from the docs

### Schema and data modeling

- Design schemas from **application access patterns**, not from generic normalization habits alone ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
- Use the flexible document model intentionally; polymorphic collections are valid when they match application needs ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).

### Collection design

- Keep data that is accessed together together, often in the same document ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
- Use separate collections when data is colder or accessed on a different cadence than the hot path ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).

### Embedding vs referencing

- Prefer embedding for closely related, co-read data ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
- Prefer referencing/separation when data has different access frequency or lifecycle characteristics ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).

### Query design

- Understand the operator category you need: comparison, logical, array, data type, and specialized predicate families are distinct tools ([Query operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/)).
- Use projections deliberately to reduce payload and focus reads, especially for arrays and metadata-heavy results ([Projection operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/projection/)).

### Index strategy

- Add indexes for repeated query patterns, but account for the write cost of each index ([Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)).
- Use indexes to avoid unnecessary collection scans; lack of a supporting index forces broader scans ([Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)).

### Aggregation usage

- Prefer aggregation pipelines over older or more limited aggregation mechanisms ([Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)).
- Keep pipeline stages purposeful and ordered to progressively narrow, enrich, or reshape data ([Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)).

### Update patterns

- Prefer update filters that encode expected current state in concurrent workflows ([Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/)).
- Use arithmetic or intent-specific operators like `$inc` instead of read-modify-overwrite patterns when concurrency matters ([Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/), [Update operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/update/)).

### Transaction usage

- Do not default to transactions for everything; MongoDB explicitly notes many practical use cases can avoid them through document design ([Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).
- Use transactions when you genuinely need multi-document, multi-collection, or cross-shard atomicity ([Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).

### Driver usage vs shell usage

- In application code, prefer the official driver for the language/runtime you are using ([MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)).
- Treat mongosh methods as shell/documentation/admin tooling, not as the main application API model ([mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/)).

### Maintainability and performance

- Favor data layouts that satisfy common reads efficiently and avoid unnecessary joins/workarounds in application code ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
- Balance read optimization with write costs when designing indexes and update patterns ([Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/), [Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/)).

## Practical defaults for future coding tasks

- Start schema design by listing the most important read and write paths, then shape documents around them ([Data modeling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/)).
- Start performance work by checking query/index fit before reaching for broader architectural changes ([Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)).
- Prefer driver-level APIs in production code and keep shell snippets clearly separated as examples or admin workflows ([MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/), [mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/)).
- Prefer single-document designs and single-document atomic operations where possible; add transactions only when requirements genuinely cross document boundaries ([Write atomicity](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/), [Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).

## Known ambiguities / version-sensitive notes

- The MongoDB docs site is a **living docs system**; exact behavior can vary by server version, driver version, and API surface, so record the relevant version when precision matters ([MongoDB docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/), [MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)).
- Some command and transaction behaviors are explicitly version-sensitive in the docs, such as `bulkWrite` being marked new in 8.0 and transaction retry caveats changing in newer versions ([CRUD commands](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/crud-commands/), [Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/)).
- The mongosh method reference is **not** a universal application API reference; it is shell-specific and explicitly distinguished from idiomatic driver usage ([mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/), [MongoDB Drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)).
- This file is intentionally condensed. For exhaustive operators, stages, and commands, use the referenced MQL, operator, command, and method index pages directly ([MQL reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mql/), [Query operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/), [Aggregation operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/), [mongosh methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/)).

<!-- cross-hub-map -->
## Cross-hub map — where every MongoDB topic lives

All MongoDB knowledge is split across **four hubs** (plus `mongodb-kb` for KB-article lookups,
`mongodb-docset-lookup` for offline Manual page lookup from the local Dash docset, and
`10gen` for repo install/run). If a task's deep material is **not** in this hub's Sub-skill routing
table, it is a reference file under a sibling hub — **activate that hub or Read its `references/<name>.md` directly**.

| Hub | Owns | Example reference files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mongodb-expert` | Core data plane + **engine internals**: CRUD/MQL, aggregation, indexes, query performance, schema design, transactions, change streams, time-series, geospatial, views, BSON, error codes, connection strings, driver internals, **WiredTiger cache/eviction/checkpoint internals**, mongosh, database tools, multi-tenancy, sharding, replication, Compass | `references/mongodb-wiredtiger-internals.md`, `mongodb-indexes-deep.md`, `mongodb-sharding.md`, `mongodb-replication.md` |
| `mongodb-atlas-expert` | Atlas **cloud platform**: control plane, Atlas Search, Vector Search, Stream Processing, Charts, Data Federation, App Services, Triggers, Online Archive, Flex, networking, IAM/RBAC, Terraform, AKO | `references/mongodb-atlas-search.md`, `mongodb-atlas-vector-search.md` |
| `atlas-diagnostics-expert` | Live **diagnostics & performance**: ts-diag, FTDC, performance-troubleshooting symptom triage, benchmarking, monitoring/observability, capacity planning | `references/mongodb-performance-troubleshooting.md` |
| `mongodb-operations-expert` | **Ops & data movement**: backup/restore, DR, Ops Manager, upgrades, migration, mongosync, relational migrator, CDC, data lifecycle, security architecture, encryption, compliance, cost, Kafka/Spark connectors | `references/mongosync.md`, `mongodb-backup-restore.md` |

**High-overlap routing notes:**
- Performance **symptom triage** (high CPU, cache pressure, slow queries, latency spikes) starts at `atlas-diagnostics-expert`, but **storage-engine root-cause internals** (WiredTiger cache fill / dirty trigger / eviction threads / reconciliation / checkpoints) are owned by `mongodb-expert` — cross-load `mongodb-expert/references/mongodb-wiredtiger-internals.md` (and `mongodb-wiredtiger.md`) for depth.
- Migration symptoms vs migration **execution**: live-cluster diagnosis → `atlas-diagnostics-expert`; the migration/mongosync runbook → `mongodb-operations-expert`.
- Atlas Search/Vector **query syntax & index design** → `mongodb-atlas-expert`; the slowness *triage* of a running search → `atlas-diagnostics-expert`.
