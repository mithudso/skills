# GPU & Accelerator Kernels for LLMs

The hardware substrate every other model-layer skill sits on. Pretraining,
fine-tuning, alignment, inference serving, and compression all ultimately
resolve to **kernels**: GPU programs that move bytes through a memory
hierarchy and feed tensor cores. This reference is the *implementation view*:
how a GPU executes work, why LLM attention and decode are bottlenecked by
**memory bandwidth** rather than FLOPs, and how kernels (CUDA, Triton,
FlashAttention, paged-KV) and compilers (torch.compile, TensorRT-LLM, XLA) are
written to fight that bottleneck.

**Where this sits among siblings (read the boundary, then the right file):**

- Distributed-parallelism **strategy** (FSDP / ZeRO / TP / PP / EP, the
  3D-placement decision) → `distributed-training`. This reference is the
  **kernel/hardware layer beneath it**: the NCCL collective *primitives*
  (all-reduce / all-gather, ring vs tree) those strategies call.
- Serving-engine **configuration and policy** (vLLM flags, continuous
  batching, speculative decoding, autoscaling) → `llm-inference-serving`. This
  reference is the **kernel mechanics beneath it**: the paged / quantized
  KV-cache *kernels* the engine schedules.
- The transformer **architecture** — why GQA/MLA shrink the KV cache, and
  FlashAttention's *math* (online softmax derivation, IO-aware exactness) →
  `transformer-architecture`. This reference is the **kernel/implementation
  view** of FlashAttention: tiling, SRAM reuse, warp specialization, WGMMA/TMA.
- Quantization **algorithms** (GPTQ, AWQ, SmoothQuant — how to *choose* the
  low-precision weights) → `llm-compression`. This reference covers the
  low-precision **kernel / tensor-core mechanics**: the FP8 / FP4 / MX / INT8
  tensor-core *paths* that make those quantized weights fast.

## When to load this reference

Load when the task is about **why GPU code is slow and how to make it fast at
the kernel level**, not about which model or which parallelism strategy:

- "Why is decode memory-bound but prefill compute-bound?" / roofline reasoning.
- "What is occupancy / a warp / an SM / SIMT?" GPU execution-model questions.
- "How does FlashAttention actually work on the hardware?" (tiling, online
  softmax in SRAM, warp specialization, ping-pong).
- "What's the difference between FP8, MXFP8, NVFP4, and INT8 on tensor cores?"
- Writing or reading a **CUDA** or **Triton** kernel; memory coalescing; shared
  memory bank conflicts; `@triton.autotune`.
- Kernel **fusion** — when it helps, when it can't (reductions).
- Paged / quantized **KV-cache kernel** internals.
- **NCCL** collective primitives — ring vs tree, why one is bandwidth-optimal
  and the other latency-optimal.
- **Profiling**: Nsight Systems vs Nsight Compute, PyTorch profiler, and
  computing **MFU** (Model FLOPs Utilization).
- The **hardware landscape**: Hopper → Blackwell (H100/H200/B200/GB200), AMD
  MI300X/MI350X, Google TPU — bandwidth/FLOPs/HBM specs and what they imply.
- **Compilers**: `torch.compile`/TorchInductor, TensorRT-LLM, XLA, Mojo.

## Core concepts (MECE)

### 1. The GPU execution model — SMs, warps, SIMT, occupancy

A GPU is a throughput machine built to **hide latency with parallelism**, the
opposite of a latency-optimized CPU. The unit of compute is the **Streaming
Multiprocessor (SM)** — a B200 has ~148 SMs, an H100 ~132. Each SM contains
arithmetic units (FP/INT), **tensor cores** (matrix-multiply accelerators), a
**register file**, **shared memory / L1**, and one or more **warp schedulers**.

- **SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Thread).** Threads are grouped into
  **warps of 32**. All 32 threads in a warp execute the *same* instruction each
  cycle on different data (lockstep). If threads in a warp take different branch
  paths (**warp divergence**), the paths execute serially with the inactive
  lanes masked off, a major performance killer.
- **Latency hiding, not latency reduction.** A warp scheduler holds many
  resident warps and, every cycle, issues from whichever warp is *ready*. When
  one warp stalls on a ~400-cycle HBM load, the SM switches to another ready
  warp instead of idling. This is why GPUs need *thousands* of threads in
  flight to reach peak throughput.
- **Occupancy** = (active warps per SM) / (max warps per SM). It is capped by
  the scarcest per-SM resource: registers per thread, shared memory per block,
  or the warp/block hardware limit. Higher occupancy gives the scheduler more
  warps to hide latency with — but it is a *means*, not a goal: a
  register-heavy, well-pipelined kernel can hit peak at modest occupancy, and
  chasing 100% occupancy by shrinking tiles can *hurt* (less work reuse). The
  Triton/CUDA tuning loop is: enough occupancy to hide memory latency, large
  enough tiles to keep tensor cores fed.

### 2. The memory hierarchy — and why attention is IO-bound

Speed and capacity trade off inversely at every level. Approximate H100/B200
figures:

| Level | Capacity | Bandwidth | Latency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Registers** (per thread) | ~256 KB/SM file | ~tens of TB/s | ~1 cycle |
| **Shared memory / L1 (SRAM)** | ~228 KB/SM (H100) | ~tens of TB/s | ~30 cycles |
| **L2 cache** | ~50 MB | ~10 TB/s | ~200 cycles |
| **HBM (global / VRAM)** | 80–192 GB | 3.35–8 TB/s | ~400+ cycles |

- **HBM3 / HBM3e** is the off-chip stacked DRAM: H100 HBM3 ≈ 3.35 TB/s, H200
  HBM3e ≈ 4.8 TB/s, B200 HBM3e ≈ 8 TB/s @ 192 GB. It is huge but ~100× slower
  per byte than SRAM.
- **SRAM (shared memory)** is the on-chip scratchpad a kernel explicitly manages
  — orders of magnitude faster than HBM but only ~hundreds of KB per SM. The
  whole game of a fast kernel is: **stage a tile into SRAM, do all the math you
  can on it, then write back** — minimizing HBM round-trips.
- **Why attention is IO-bound.** Naive attention materializes the full
  `S = QKᵀ` score matrix (size O(seq²)) in HBM, runs softmax over it (another
  HBM read + write), then multiplies by V (another read). The *arithmetic* is
  cheap relative to the *bytes moved*, so the kernel spends most of its time
  waiting on HBM. FlashAttention exists precisely to keep `S` in SRAM and never
  write it to HBM (see §8).

### 3. Arithmetic intensity and the roofline model

**Arithmetic intensity (AI)** = FLOPs performed ÷ bytes moved from memory
(FLOP/byte). The **roofline model** plots attainable FLOP/s against AI:

- A sloped line (peak bandwidth × AI) on the left: the **memory-bound** region.
- A flat line (peak compute) on the right: the **compute-bound** region.
- The **ridge point** is where they cross — the AI at which a kernel transitions
  from bandwidth-limited to compute-limited. For H100 BF16 the ridge is roughly
  ~300 FLOP/byte; a kernel below it cannot reach peak FLOP/s no matter how fast
  the math units are.

**The decisive LLM consequence:**

- **Prefill (prompt processing)** is **compute-bound.** It is a big
  matrix–matrix multiply (GEMM): a long sequence × weight matrices → high AI,
  reuses each loaded weight across many tokens. Prefill wants high AI and is
  limited by tensor-core FLOP/s.
- **Decode (autoregressive generation)** is **memory-bandwidth-bound.** To emit
  *one* token you must stream the *entire* weight matrix (and the growing KV
  cache) from HBM, but you only do a matrix–*vector* multiply (batch=1) — almost
  no reuse, AI ≈ O(1). Decode latency ≈ (model bytes + KV bytes) ÷ HBM
  bandwidth. This is why: (a) decode throughput tracks HBM bandwidth, not FLOPs;
  (b) **batching** raises AI (reuse weights across many sequences) and is the
  single biggest decode-throughput lever; (c) **quantization** (fewer bytes per
  weight) directly speeds decode; (d) KV-cache size directly costs latency.

### 4. Precision and tensor cores — BF16 / FP8 / FP4 / MX / INT8

**Tensor cores** are dedicated matrix-multiply-accumulate (MMA) units: they
multiply small tiles (e.g. 16×16) and accumulate, delivering ~10–30× the FLOP/s
of the general FP units. Lower precision = more tensor-core throughput *and*
fewer bytes to move (helps the memory-bound regime), so the precision frontier
is the central lever for both training and inference speed.

- **FP16 / BF16.** 16-bit. BF16 (8-bit exponent, 7-bit mantissa) has the same
  dynamic range as FP32 — the default training/inference precision; rarely
  overflows, so usually no loss scaling.
- **TF32.** A 19-bit internal tensor-core mode for FP32 inputs (10-bit
  mantissa); a near-free Ampere+ speedup for FP32 workloads.
- **FP8 (E4M3 / E5M2).** 8-bit, native on Hopper+ tensor cores. E4M3 (more
  mantissa) for forward/weights, E5M2 (more range) for gradients. Needs
  **scaling** (per-tensor delayed scaling, or finer) to fit values in the narrow
  range. H100 FP8 ≈ 2× its BF16 FLOP/s.
- **MX microscaling formats (OCP standard).** Instead of one scale per
  tensor/row, an **MX block of 32 consecutive elements shares one power-of-two
  scale** stored as **UE8M0** (8-bit exponent). **MXFP8** = FP8 (E4M3/E5M2)
  elements + 1×32 block scale; **MXFP4** = FP4 (E2M1) elements + 1×32 block
  scale; MXFP6 also exists. Finer-grained scaling than per-tensor → better
  accuracy at low bit-width. Native on Blackwell (SM 10.0+).
- **NVFP4 (NVIDIA's Blackwell FP4).** Compatible E2M1 elements but a **smaller
  block of 16** with **two-level scaling**: a per-block **FP8 E4M3** scale plus a
  per-tensor FP32 scale. The smaller block + higher-precision scale localizes to
  the data's dynamic range better than MXFP4's 32-block UE8M0 scale, giving
  lower quantization error. Blackwell's 5th-gen tensor cores handle FP4
  grouping, dynamic scaling, and the 4-bit MMA in hardware. Reported: ~3.5×
  smaller memory vs FP16, ~1.8× vs FP8, with <1% accuracy degradation on key
  LM tasks for many models. **Block size is hardware-fixed** — picking the wrong
  block produces a checkpoint the tensor cores can't consume.
- **INT8.** Integer 8-bit MMA, very high throughput (H100 INT8 ≈ 2× BF16);
  common for weight/activation quant (W8A8) and KV-cache quant. Needs careful
  scale/zero-point calibration.

> path** those algorithms target.

### 5. CUDA basics — kernels, grids/blocks, coalescing, shared memory

CUDA is the C++ dialect for writing GPU kernels. The launch hierarchy:

- A **kernel** is a function run by many threads. You launch it over a **grid**
  of **thread blocks**; each block holds up to 1024 **threads** (executed as
  warps of 32). `blockIdx`, `threadIdx`, `blockDim` index the data each thread
  owns. A block runs entirely on one SM and shares that SM's shared memory.
- **Memory coalescing** is the #1 global-memory rule: when the 32 threads of a
  warp access *consecutive, aligned* addresses, the hardware merges them into
  one (or a few) wide HBM transactions. Strided or scattered access splits into
  many transactions and wastes most of the bandwidth, the dominant cause of a
  slow memory-bound kernel.
- **Shared memory** is the SRAM scratchpad a block uses to stage and reuse data.
  **Tiled matmul** is the canonical pattern: each block cooperatively loads a
  tile of A and B from HBM into shared memory (coalesced), does the partial dot
  products from SRAM, advances to the next tile. This converts repeated HBM
  reads into one HBM read + many SRAM reads, raising arithmetic intensity.
- **Bank conflicts.** Shared memory is split into 32 banks. If multiple threads
  in a warp hit *different* addresses in the *same* bank, the accesses serialize.
  The standard fix is **padding** (e.g. a `[32][33]` tile) so consecutive
  threads land in distinct banks.
- **CUDA graphs** capture a sequence of kernel launches and replay them as one
  unit, eliminating per-launch CPU overhead, which matters in decode, where each
  step is many tiny kernels (see §13 for the compiler/CUDA-graph tie-in).

### 6. Triton — block-level kernels and autotuning

**OpenAI Triton** is a Python DSL+compiler for GPU kernels at a *tile* (block)
granularity, sitting between hand-CUDA and framework ops. You write what each
program instance does to a **block of data**; the compiler handles
intra-block thread scheduling, vectorization, **shared-memory allocation, and
coalescing automatically** — you do not manage individual threads or banks.

- **Programming model:** `@triton.jit`; `pid = tl.program_id(0)` identifies the
  block; `BLOCK_SIZE` is a `tl.constexpr`; `tl.load(ptr + offs, mask=...)` /
  `tl.store(...)` move tiles with boundary masks; `tl.dot(a, b)` issues a
  tensor-core matmul on tiles.
- **Autotuning:** decorate with `@triton.autotune(configs=[triton.Config({...},
  num_warps=, num_stages=), ...], key=[...])`. On first call for a new shape
  (the `key`), Triton benchmarks every config on the *real* tensor sizes and
  memoizes the winner: cuDNN-style autotuning with no C++ build. `num_stages`
  controls software pipelining (overlapping loads with compute);
  `num_warps` sets the block's warp count.
- **Why it matters for LLMs:** Triton is the backend `torch.compile` generates
  fused kernels into (§13), and the language most custom LLM kernels
  (fused softmax, layernorm, fused-attention, MoE grouped GEMM, quant kernels)
  are now written in. The official tutorials walk vector-add → fused-softmax →
  autotuned matmul → fused-attention → block-scaled (MX) matmul.

### 7. Kernel fusion

**Fusion** combines a sequence of operations into a *single* kernel so
intermediates stay in registers/SRAM and are never written to HBM. It removes
(a) HBM round-trips of intermediate tensors and (b) per-op kernel-launch
overhead.

- **Best targets:** chains of **elementwise** and **tile-local** ops —
  `bias → activation → dropout`, `RMSNorm → matmul` preambles, dequant +
  matmul. LLM forward/backward fire hundreds of tiny ops; fusing them is a large
  win on launch overhead and memory traffic.
- **Hard / impossible to fuse:** **reductions with long-range dependencies**
  (softmax across a long axis, large all-reduce) need cross-tile/cross-SM
  communication that breaks single-kernel streaming. FlashAttention is the
  clever exception: it fuses attention by reformulating softmax into an
  *online/streaming* recurrence (§8) so no full-row reduction is materialized.
- **Memory-bound ops benefit most** (they were limited by bytes, and fusion cuts
  bytes); compute-bound GEMMs benefit less from fusion itself but still gain from
  fused epilogues (bias/activation folded into the GEMM store).

### 8. FlashAttention — the kernel case study (implementation view)

FlashAttention is **IO-aware *exact* attention**: same result as standard
attention, but it never materializes the O(seq²) score matrix in HBM. (The
*math/derivation* and the architecture motivation live in
`transformer-architecture`; here is *how the kernel is built*.)

- **Tiling.** Q, K, V are split into blocks. The kernel loops over K/V blocks,
  loading each Q/K/V tile from HBM into **SRAM**, computing the partial scores
  and partial output *there*, and accumulating, so the score tile lives only in
  SRAM and is discarded, never written to HBM.
- **Online (streaming) softmax.** Softmax normally needs the whole row's max and
  sum first. FlashAttention keeps a running max `m` and running denominator `ℓ`
  and **rescales** the accumulated output as each new K/V block arrives,
  producing the exact softmax without ever holding the full row. This is what
  makes attention fusible into one kernel.
- **Recomputation in the backward pass.** Rather than store the huge
  intermediate `S`, the backward pass *recomputes* tiles from the saved stats —
  trading a little extra FLOPs for a large HBM-traffic/memory saving (a
  selective-recompute idea).
- **FlashAttention-2** raised tensor-core utilization by reducing non-matmul
  FLOPs, better work partitioning across warps, and parallelizing over the
  sequence dimension.
- **FlashAttention-3 (Hopper).** Exploits Hopper asynchrony: **warp
  specialization** (producer warps issue **TMA** async copies HBM→SRAM while
  consumer warps run **WGMMA** tensor-core matmuls), **ping-pong scheduling**
  between two warpgroups (one does GEMM while the other does softmax — ~570→620
  TFLOPS), and **intra-warpgroup pipelining** of softmax with GEMM (→~640–660
  TFLOPS FP16). It adds **FP8** attention with **incoherent processing** (a
  random-sign Hadamard transform in O(d log d) to spread outliers), cutting FP8
  error ~2.6× vs baseline. Result: **~740 TFLOPS FP16 (~75% of H100 peak,** up
  from ~35%), 1.5–2.0× over FA-2; **~1.2 PFLOPS in FP8**.

### 9. Paged and quantized KV-cache kernels

The KV cache (cached keys/values for every past token) grows with sequence and
batch and dominates decode memory. Two kernel-level techniques:

- **PagedAttention kernel.** Inspired by OS virtual memory: the KV cache is
  stored in fixed-size **blocks (pages)**, not one contiguous per-sequence
  buffer. A per-sequence **block table** maps logical token positions to
  physical blocks, so blocks can be allocated on demand and **shared** across
  sequences (e.g. a shared prompt prefix, or beams). The attention kernel
  gathers K/V through the block table instead of a flat stride. This cuts KV
  fragmentation/waste to <4% and is what lets a server pack many more concurrent
  sequences (2–4× throughput). *Engine policy* (which sequences to batch,
  eviction, prefix caching) is `llm-inference-serving`; this is the *kernel*
  that the policy schedules.
- **Quantized KV-cache kernels.** Storing K/V in **FP8** (recommended on
  Hopper/Blackwell) or **INT8** halves/quarters KV bytes, directly relieving the
  memory-bandwidth-bound decode path and extending context length. The kernel
  must dequantize on the fly inside the attention compute (or use low-precision
  MMA paths). vLLM ships FP8 KV-cache; INT8 KV-cache kernels (naive/tiled/
  coarsened/vectorized variants) report up to 4× KV memory reduction with small
  accuracy loss.

### 10. NCCL collectives — the communication primitives (ring vs tree)

When a model spans many GPUs, the parallelism *strategy*
(`distributed-training`) is implemented on top of **NCCL** collective
**primitives**. The ones that matter:

- **all-reduce** — sum (or other op) a tensor across all ranks, every rank gets
  the result (gradient sync in data parallel; the per-block sum in tensor
  parallel).
- **all-gather** — each rank contributes a shard, every rank ends with the full
  concatenation (FSDP/ZeRO parameter gather).
- **reduce-scatter** — reduce then partition (the FSDP gradient half;
  reduce-scatter + all-gather = one ring all-reduce).
- **all-to-all** — every rank sends a distinct piece to every other rank (MoE
  expert dispatch/combine).

**Ring vs tree (the central trade-off):**

- **Ring all-reduce** arranges ranks in a logical ring and streams shards
  around it (reduce-scatter phase + all-gather phase). It is **bandwidth-optimal
  — each link is fully utilized and per-rank traffic is independent of rank
  count** — but its **latency grows linearly** with the number of ranks (~2(N−1)
  steps), so it is poor for tiny messages at large scale.
- **Tree all-reduce** reduces up a (double-)binary tree and broadcasts down.
  Latency is **logarithmic** in N, so it wins for **small, latency-sensitive**
  messages and large clusters.
- **NCCL auto-selects** per call: it models each algorithm×protocol's latency and
  bandwidth and picks the predicted winner by message size — tree for small,
  ring for large — and tunes to the topology (NVLink/NVSwitch intra-node, the
  network inter-node). Newer **PAT** (Parallel Aggregated Trees) gives
  logarithmic all-gather/reduce-scatter at scale. *Overlapping* collectives with
  compute (so comm hides behind matmuls) is the strategy-level lever covered in
  `distributed-training`.

### 11. Profiling and Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU)

You cannot optimize what you cannot measure; raw "GPU utilization" (percent of
time a kernel was resident) is **misleading** — it can read 100% while tensor
cores sit mostly idle. The real efficiency metric is **MFU**.

- **MFU (Model FLOPs Utilization)** = (model's *useful* FLOP/s, e.g. the `6ND`
  training estimate or the inference FLOPs) ÷ (the hardware's peak FLOP/s at that
  precision). It is hardware-agnostic and tells you how close you are to the
  roofline. **40–50% sustained MFU** is a good real-world training target;
  decode is far lower because it is memory-bound (low AI), so MFU is the wrong
  lens for decode — there, % of peak *bandwidth* is the metric. (HFU, *hardware*
  FLOPs utilization, additionally counts recomputed FLOPs.)
- **Nsight Systems (`nsys`)** — system-wide timeline: CPU↔GPU overlap, kernel
  gaps, stream/launch behavior, NCCL. Low overhead; the *first* tool — find the
  top/longest or stalling kernels and the bubbles.
- **Nsight Compute (`ncu`)** — single-kernel deep dive: achieved occupancy,
  memory vs compute bound, the kernel's roofline, warp-stall reasons, bank
  conflicts. The *second* tool, once Nsight Systems names the suspect kernel.
- **PyTorch profiler** (`torch.profiler` + TensorBoard / Holistic Trace
  Analysis / Chrome trace) — medium overhead, framework-aware: maps kernels back
  to model ops, with stack traces, shapes, and memory. Best for "which *layer*
  is slow" and for correlating Python with kernels.
- Typical loop: Nsight Systems → find bubbles / a hot kernel → Nsight Compute →
  classify (memory- vs compute-bound on the roofline) → fix (coalesce, fuse,
  raise occupancy/tile size, change precision) → re-measure MFU.

### 12. The hardware landscape (Hopper → Blackwell, MI300X, TPU)

Bandwidth and FLOPs set the roofline; HBM capacity sets how big a model/KV cache
fits. Approximate per-accelerator figures (2024–mid-2026):

| Accelerator | Arch | HBM | Bandwidth | Peak dense tensor | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **H100** | Hopper | 80 GB HBM3 | ~3.35 TB/s | ~990 TF BF16 / ~1979 TF FP8 | WGMMA, TMA, FP8; the 2023–24 workhorse |
| **H200** | Hopper | 141 GB HBM3e | ~4.8 TB/s | same as H100 | bandwidth/capacity bump → faster decode |
| **B200** | Blackwell | 192 GB HBM3e | ~8 TB/s | ~4.5 PF BF16 / ~9 PF FP8 | 5th-gen tensor cores, native MXFP8/NVFP4, FP4 |
| **GB200** | Blackwell | Grace+2×B200 | NVLink-C2C | ~3–3.4× H100/GPU | NVL72 rack = 72 GPUs on one NVLink fabric |
| **AMD MI300X** | CDNA3 | 192 GB HBM3 | ~5.3 TB/s | high BF16/FP8 (ROCm) | big HBM; CUDA-moat gap on software/kernels |
| **AMD MI350X** | CDNA4 | 288 GB HBM3e | ~8 TB/s | + FP4/FP6 | most HBM capacity; competes with B200 |
| **Google TPU v6e** | TPU | HBM | high | ~0.918 PF BF16 | systolic MXU, XLA-only, pod-scale ICI |

Takeaways: (1) each generation's **bandwidth** jump is what speeds *decode*;
(2) Blackwell's **FP4/MXFP8** is what makes 4-bit inference fast in hardware;
(3) NVLink/NVSwitch fabric (GB200 NVL72) makes large collectives intra-fabric;
(4) NVIDIA's lead is partly the **kernel/software moat** (CUDA, cuDNN, NCCL,
TensorRT, FlashAttention) — AMD MI300X has competitive *silicon* (more HBM) but
historically trails on ready kernels; TPU is strong but **XLA-only** (no CUDA).

### 13. Compilers — torch.compile / TorchInductor, TensorRT-LLM, XLA, Mojo

Compilers turn a high-level model graph into fused, scheduled kernels so humans
don't hand-write each one.

- **`torch.compile` (PyTorch 2.x).** Front end **TorchDynamo** captures the graph;
  back end **TorchInductor** lowers it to **fused Triton kernels** (GPU) /
  C++/OpenMP (CPU). Fusion of elementwise chains + reduced launch overhead is the
  main speedup; pairs with **CUDA graphs** to kill per-launch cost. It is the
  default acceleration path and the one **vLLM** now uses (`-O3`, piecewise CUDA
  graphs) for its model code.
- **TensorRT-LLM.** NVIDIA's inference compiler/runtime: aggressive deep
  graph fusion, fused multi-head attention, FP8/FP4 paths, in-flight batching,
  **piecewise CUDA graphs**, and it now *uses* `torch.compile` for lightweight
  vertical fusion. Tends to win on large models where deep fusion pays off;
  `torch.compile` alone can match or beat it on smaller models.
- **XLA.** Google's array compiler (JAX, TF, TPU; PyTorch/XLA). The native path
  for **TPUs** and whole-graph fusion via HLO; on NVIDIA GPUs its gains over
  `torch.compile` are usually modest.
- **Mojo.** Modular's Python-superset systems language aimed at writing portable
  high-performance kernels (an alternative to CUDA C++/Triton, MLIR-based);
  emerging, not yet a default in mainstream LLM stacks — watch, don't depend.

---

## Practical patterns

- **Diagnose with the roofline first.** Before optimizing, classify the kernel:
  memory-bound or compute-bound (Nsight Compute draws this). Memory-bound →
  coalesce, fuse, raise reuse, drop precision. Compute-bound → bigger tiles, use
  tensor cores, lower precision.
- **Decode = bandwidth problem.** To speed decode: **batch** (raise AI),
  **quantize weights + KV** (fewer bytes), shrink the KV cache (GQA/MLA — an
  *architecture* lever in `transformer-architecture`), use **CUDA graphs** to
  kill launch overhead. Do *not* expect more FLOPs to help.
- **Prefer Triton + autotune over hand-CUDA** for new custom kernels unless you
  need an instruction the DSL can't express; let the compiler handle banks and
  coalescing, and let `@triton.autotune` find tile sizes per shape.
- **Let `torch.compile` fuse first.** Reach for hand kernels only where the
  compiler leaves bandwidth on the table (profile to prove it).
- **Match the precision to the hardware's fixed block size.** On Blackwell, NVFP4
  wants 16-element blocks, MXFP8 wants 32 — quantize to the format the tensor
  cores actually consume.
- **Measure MFU for training, % peak bandwidth for decode.** Report the right
  metric for the regime; a "100% GPU utilization" claim with low MFU means the
  tensor cores are starved.

## Anti-patterns

- **Chasing 100% occupancy.** Occupancy is a means to hide latency, not a target;
  shrinking tiles to raise it can lower reuse and *hurt* throughput.
- **Trusting `nvidia-smi` "GPU-Util".** It reports time a kernel was resident,
  not tensor-core efficiency; use MFU / Nsight Compute instead.
- **Strided / uncoalesced global access** in the hot loop — the most common cause
  of a memory-bound kernel running at a fraction of HBM bandwidth.
- **Trying to fuse a long-range reduction** (e.g. naive softmax across the whole
  sequence) into one streaming kernel — it needs cross-tile communication;
  reformulate (online softmax) or keep it separate.
- **Optimizing FLOPs to speed decode.** Decode is bandwidth-bound; FLOP-side
  tuning yields little. Optimize bytes moved.
- **Ignoring the fixed MX/NVFP4 block size** — a wrong block size produces a
  checkpoint the tensor cores cannot run.
- **Hand-writing CUDA before profiling.** Premature kernel hacking before the
  roofline tells you what's actually limiting.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely kernel-level cause | Where to look |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decode throughput far below HBM bandwidth ÷ model bytes | Tiny per-step kernels, launch overhead, no CUDA graph; KV not paged | Nsight Systems timeline (gaps); enable CUDA graphs / paged KV |
| Low MFU in training but GPU "100% util" | Memory-bound or starved tensor cores; small tiles | Nsight Compute roofline; bigger tiles, fuse, FP8/BF16 |
| Attention OOMs at long context | Materializing O(seq²) scores | Use FlashAttention; check it's actually engaged |
| Multi-GPU step dominated by comm | Collective not overlapped; wrong ring/tree at this size | `nsys` for NCCL; let NCCL tune; overlap (strategy → `distributed-training`) |
| FP8/FP4 accuracy collapses | Bad scaling / wrong block size / outliers | Per-block (MX/NVFP4) scaling; Hadamard/incoherent processing; recalibrate |
| Slow shared-memory kernel | Bank conflicts | Nsight Compute "shared bank conflicts"; pad tiles |
| Quantized weights load but run slow | Falling off the tensor-core fast path (format mismatch) | Confirm the quant format matches the GPU's MMA path |
